      "The sky appears blue to our eyes because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it in the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight from the sun enters our atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
      "2. **Scattering occurs**: These gas molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is because the smaller molecules are better at interacting with the smaller wavelength light.\n",
      "3. **Blue light dominates**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed evenly throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky.\n",
      "4. **Our brains perceive blue**: When we look up at the sky, our brains interpret the scattered blue light as the color blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same principle applies to other objects that appear blue, such as a clear summer day or a cloudless blue sea. In these cases, the shorter wavelengths of light are being scattered by tiny particles in the air or water, making them appear blue to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some interesting facts about why the sky is blue:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The color of the sky can vary depending on the time of day and atmospheric conditions. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the scattering of longer wavelengths.\n",
      "* The Earth's atmosphere is not perfectly transparent, which means that some light is absorbed or reflected before it reaches our eyes. This is why the sky often appears more pale blue than a deep shade.\n",
      "* Space agencies like NASA have studied the color of the sky on other planets and moons in our solar system. For example, Venus has a thick atmosphere that scatters shorter wavelengths, making its sky appear more yellowish or orange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, go outside and appreciate that beautiful blue sky!\n"

BIAGIO INGROIA,\\r\\nPREZIOSO ALLEATO\\r\\nL’AUTORE RICONOSCENTE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\\n\\r\\nThis translation is intended to supplement a work entitled “The Authoress of\\r\\nthe Odyssey”, which I published in 1897. I could not give the whole “Odyssey”\\r\\nin that book without making it unwieldy, I therefore epitomised my translation,\\r\\nwhich was already completed and which I now publish in full.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just\\r\\nmentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I have\\r\\nthere written. The points in question are:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(1) that the “Odyssey” was written entirely at, and drawn entirely from, the\\r\\nplace now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike as regards the\\r\\nPhaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of Ulysses, when once he is\\r\\nwithin easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves into a periplus of the island,\\r\\npractically from Trapani back to Trapani, via the Lipari islands, the Straits\\r\\nof Messina, and the island of Pantellaria.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived at the\\r\\nplace now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work under the name\\r\\nof Nausicaa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat startling\\r\\ncontentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the English and\\r\\nItalian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder) in the “Athenaeum”\\r\\nfor January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both contentions were urged (also without\\r\\nrejoinder) in the Johnian “Eagle” for the Lent and October terms of the same\\r\\nyear. Nothing to which I should reply has reached me from any quarter, and\\r\\nknowing how anxiously I have endeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in\\r\\nmy argument, I begin to feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I\\r\\nshould have heard, at any rate about some of them, before now. Without,\\r\\ntherefore, for a moment pretending to think that scholars generally acquiesce\\r\\nin my conclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely so to gainsay me\\r\\nas that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and shall confine myself to\\r\\ntranslating the “Odyssey” for English readers, with such notes as I think will\\r\\nbe found useful. Among these I would especially call attention to one on xxii.\\r\\n465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe has kindly allowed me to make public.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have repeated several of the illustrations used in “The Authoress of the\\r\\nOdyssey”, and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court of Ulysses’\\r\\nhouse more vividly before the reader. I should like to explain that the\\r\\npresence of a man and a dog in one illustration is accidental, and was not\\r\\nobserved by me till I developed the negative. In an appendix I have also\\r\\nreprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the plan of Ulysses’ house, together\\r\\nwith the plan itself. The reader is recommended to study this plan with some\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the preface to my translation of the “Iliad” I have given my views as to the\\r\\nmain principles by which a translator should be guided, and need not repeat\\r\\nthem here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty of translating poetry\\r\\ninto prose involves the continual taking of more or less liberty throughout the\\r\\ntranslation; for much that is right in poetry is wrong in prose, and the\\r\\nexigencies of readable prose are the first things to be considered in a prose\\r\\ntranslation. That the reader, however, may see how far I have departed from\\r\\nstrict construe, I will print here Messrs. Butcher and Lang’s translation of\\r\\nthe sixty lines or so of the “Odyssey.” Their translation runs:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered far and wide, after\\r\\nhe had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy, and many were the men whose towns he\\r\\nsaw and whose mind he learnt, yea, and many the woes he suffered in his heart\\r\\non the deep, striving to win his own life and the return of his company. Nay,\\r\\nbut even so he saved not his company, though he desired it sore. For through\\r\\nthe blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the oxen\\r\\nof Helios Hyperion: but the god took from them their day of returning. Of these\\r\\nthings, goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,\\r\\ndeclare thou even unto us.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at home, and\\r\\nhad escaped both war and sea, but Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for\\r\\nhis homeward path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in her\\r\\nhollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But when now the year had come\\r\\nin the courses of the seasons, wherein the gods had ordained that he should\\r\\nreturn home to Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even among\\r\\nhis own; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually\\r\\nagainst godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had\\r\\nnow departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in\\r\\ntwain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where\\r\\nhe rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he\\r\\nmade merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in the halls\\r\\nof Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of men and gods began to speak,\\r\\nfor he bethought him in his heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of\\r\\nAgamemnon, far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among the\\r\\nImmortals:\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they say\\r\\ncomes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own\\r\\nhearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,\\r\\nbeyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of\\r\\nAtreus, and killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his\\r\\neyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the\\r\\nslayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the\\r\\nson of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come\\r\\nto man’s estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed\\r\\nnot on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid one\\r\\nprice for all.’\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: ‘O father, our\\r\\nfather Cronides, throned in the highest; that man assuredly lies in a death\\r\\nthat is his due; so perish likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is\\r\\nrent for wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends this long\\r\\nwhile suffereth affliction in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a\\r\\nwoodland isle, and therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the\\r\\nwizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall\\r\\npillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His daughter it is that holds the\\r\\nhapless man in sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him\\r\\nto forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the\\r\\nsmoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine\\r\\nheart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by the ships of\\r\\nthe Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land?\\r\\nWherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe “Odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from the\\r\\n“Iliad”; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type, with\\r\\nmarginal references to the “Iliad,” and had marked them to this end in my MS. I\\r\\nfound, however, that the translation would be thus hopelessly scholasticised,\\r\\nand abandoned my intention. I would nevertheless urge on those who have the\\r\\nmanagement of our University presses, that they would render a great service to\\r\\nstudents if they would publish a Greek text of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic\\r\\npassages printed in a different type, and with marginal references. I have\\r\\ngiven the British Museum a copy of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages\\r\\nunderlined and referred to in MS.; I have also given an “Iliad” marked with all\\r\\nthe Odyssean passages, and their references; but copies of both the “Iliad” and\\r\\n“Odyssey” so marked ought to be within easy reach of all students.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAny one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen round\\r\\nthe “Iliad” since Wolf’s time, without keeping it well before his reader’s mind\\r\\nthat the “Odyssey” was demonstrably written from one single neighbourhood, and\\r\\nhence (even though nothing else pointed to this conclusion) presumably by one\\r\\nperson only—that it was written certainly before 750, and in all probability\\r\\nbefore 1000 B.C.—that the writer of this very early poem was demonstrably\\r\\nfamiliar with the “Iliad” as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those\\r\\nbooks whose genuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are\\r\\nadmitted to be by Homer—any one who fails to keep these points before his\\r\\nreaders, is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who\\r\\nwill mark his “Iliad” and his “Odyssey” from the copies in the British Museum\\r\\nabove referred to, and who will draw the only inference that common sense can\\r\\ndraw from the presence of so many identical passages in both poems, will, I\\r\\nbelieve, find no difficulty in assigning their proper value to a large number\\r\\nof books here and on the Continent that at present enjoy considerable\\r\\nreputations. Furthermore, and this perhaps is an advantage better worth\\r\\nsecuring, he will find that many puzzles of the “Odyssey” cease to puzzle him\\r\\non the discovery that they arise from over-saturation with the “Iliad.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOther difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of the poem\\r\\nin the writer’s mind is understood. I have dealt with this at some length in\\r\\npp. 251-261 of “The Authoress of the Odyssey”. Briefly, the “Odyssey” consists\\r\\nof two distinct poems: (1) The Return of Ulysses, which alone the Muse is asked\\r\\nto sing in the opening lines of the poem. This poem includes the Phaeacian\\r\\nepisode, and the account of Ulysses’ adventures as told by himself in Books\\r\\nix.-xii. It consists of lines 1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v.,\\r\\nand thence without intermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at\\r\\nwhich point the original scheme was abandoned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of Telemachus’\\r\\nvoyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly) of Book i., is\\r\\ncontinued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till Ulysses wakes in the\\r\\nmiddle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it continues to the end of Book\\r\\nxxiv.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn “The Authoress of the Odyssey”, I wrote:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nthe introduction of lines xi., 115-137 and of line ix., 535, with the writing a\\r\\nnew council of the gods at the beginning of Book v., to take the place of the\\r\\none that was removed to Book i., 1-79, were the only things that were done to\\r\\ngive even a semblance of unity to the old scheme and the new, and to conceal\\r\\nthe fact that the Muse, after being asked to sing of one subject, spend\\r\\ntwo-thirds of her time in singing a very different one, with a climax for which\\r\\nno-one has asked her. For roughly the Return occupies eight Books, and Penelope\\r\\nand the Suitors sixteen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI believe this to be substantially correct.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLastly, to deal with a very unimportant point, I observe that the Leipsic\\r\\nTeubner edition of 894 makes Books ii. and iii. end with a comma. Stops are\\r\\nthings of such far more recent date than the “Odyssey,” that there does not\\r\\nseem much use in adhering to the text in so small a matter; still, from a\\r\\nspirit of mere conservatism, I have preferred to do so. Why [Greek] at the\\r\\nbeginnings of Books ii. and viii., and [Greek], at the beginning of Book vii.\\r\\nshould have initial capitals in an edition far too careful to admit a\\r\\nsupposition of inadvertence, when [Greek] at the beginning of Books vi. and\\r\\nxiii., and [Greek] at the beginning of Book xvii. have no initial capitals, I\\r\\ncannot determine. No other Books of the “Odyssey” have initial capitals except\\r\\nthe three mentioned unless the first word of the Book is a proper name.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nS. BUTLER.\\r\\n\\n\\nJuly 25, 1900.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION\\n\\r\\nButler’s Translation of the “Odyssey” appeared originally in 1900, and The\\r\\nAuthoress of the Odyssey in 1897. In the preface to the new edition of “The\\r\\nAuthoress”, which is published simultaneously with this new edition of the\\r\\nTranslation, I have given some account of the genesis of the two books.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe size of the original page has been reduced so as to make both books uniform\\r\\nwith Butler’s other works; and, fortunately, it has been possible, by using a\\r\\nsmaller type, to get the same number of words into each page, so that the\\r\\nreferences remain good, and, with the exception of a few minor alterations and\\r\\nrearrangements now to be enumerated so far as they affect the Translation, the\\r\\nnew editions are faithful reprints of the original editions, with misprints and\\r\\nobvious errors corrected—no attempt having been made to edit them or to bring\\r\\nthem up to date.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(a) The Index has been revised.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(b) Owing to the reduction in the size of the page it has been necessary to\\r\\nshorten some of the headlines, and here advantage has been taken of various\\r\\ncorrections of and additions to the headlines and shoulder-notes made by Butler\\r\\nin his own copies of the two books.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(c) For the most part each of the illustrations now occupies a page, whereas in\\r\\nthe original editions they generally appeared two on the page. It has been\\r\\nnecessary to reduce the plan of the House of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn page 153 of “The Authoress” Butler says: “No great poet would compare his\\r\\nhero to a paunch full of blood and fat, cooking before the fire (xx, 24-28).”\\r\\nThis passage is not given in the abridged Story of the “Odyssey” at the\\r\\nbeginning of the book, but in the Translation it occurs in these words:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he tossed\\r\\nabout as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire,\\r\\ndoing it first on one side then on the other, that he may get it cooked as soon\\r\\nas possible; even so did he turn himself about from side to side, thinking all\\r\\nthe time how, single-handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a\\r\\nbody of men as the wicked suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt looks as though in the interval between the publication of “The Authoress”\\r\\n(1897) and of the Translation (1900) Butler had changed his mind; for in the\\r\\nfirst case the comparison is between Ulysses and a paunch full, etc., and in\\r\\nthe second it is between Ulysses and a man who turns a paunch full, etc. The\\r\\nsecond comparison is perhaps one which a great poet might make.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn seeing the works through the press I have had the invaluable assistance of\\r\\nMr. A. T. Bartholomew of the University Library, Cambridge, and of Mr. Donald\\r\\nS. Robertson, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. To both these friends I\\r\\ngive my most cordial thanks for the care and skill exercised by them. Mr.\\r\\nRobertson has found time for the labour of checking and correcting all the\\r\\nquotations from and references to the “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” and I believe that\\r\\nit could not have been better performed. It was, I know, a pleasure for him;\\r\\nand it would have been a pleasure also for Butler if he could have known that\\r\\nhis work was being shepherded by the son of his old friend, Mr. H. R.\\r\\nRobertson, who more than half a century ago was a fellow-student with him at\\r\\nCary’s School of Art in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHENRY FESTING JONES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n120 MAIDA VALE, W.9.\\r\\n4th December, 1921.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTHE ODYSSEY\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK I\\n\\r\\nTHE GODS IN COUNCIL—MINERVA’S VISIT TO ITHACA—THE CHALLENGE FROM TELEMACHUS TO\\r\\nTHE SUITORS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had\\r\\nsacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the\\r\\nnations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered\\r\\nmuch by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home;\\r\\nbut do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their\\r\\nown sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god\\r\\nprevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things,\\r\\noh daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home\\r\\nexcept Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife and\\r\\ncountry, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large cave\\r\\nand wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods\\r\\nsettled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among\\r\\nhis own people, his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had\\r\\nnow begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing\\r\\nand would not let him get home.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world’s end, and lie\\r\\nin two halves, the one looking West and the other East.[1] He had gone there to accept a hecatomb\\r\\nof sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods\\r\\nmet in the house of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At\\r\\nthat moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon’s\\r\\nson Orestes; so he said to the other gods:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing but\\r\\ntheir own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to Agamemnon’s wife\\r\\nunrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would be the death of\\r\\nhim; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch\\r\\nas Orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to\\r\\nreturn home. Mercury told him this in all good will but he would not listen,\\r\\nand now he has paid for everything in full.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva said, “Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served Aegisthus\\r\\nright, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but Aegisthus is\\r\\nneither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when I think of\\r\\nhis sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his\\r\\nfriends. It is an island covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea,\\r\\nand a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the\\r\\nbottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth\\r\\nasunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps\\r\\ntrying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he is\\r\\ntired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of\\r\\nhis own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was\\r\\nbefore Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then\\r\\nshould you keep on being so angry with him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Jove said, “My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget Ulysses\\r\\nthan whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more liberal in his\\r\\nofferings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear in mind, however, that\\r\\nNeptune is still furious with Ulysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus\\r\\nking of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa,\\r\\ndaughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will not kill Ulysses\\r\\noutright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home. Still, let us\\r\\nlay our heads together and see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then\\r\\nbe pacified, for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Minerva said, “Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the gods now\\r\\nmean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury to the Ogygian\\r\\nisland to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and that he is to return.\\r\\nIn the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart into Ulysses’ son Telemachus;\\r\\nI will embolden him to call the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the\\r\\nsuitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his\\r\\nsheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he\\r\\ncan hear anything about the return of his dear father—for this will make people\\r\\nspeak well of him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable, with which\\r\\nshe can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the redoubtable\\r\\nbronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells the\\r\\nranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted from the topmost\\r\\nsummits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of\\r\\nUlysses’ house, disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she\\r\\nheld a bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on\\r\\nhides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in\\r\\nfront of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon\\r\\nthem, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the\\r\\ntables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up great\\r\\nquantities of meat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily among\\r\\nthe suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send them flying\\r\\nout of the house, if he were to come to his own again and be honoured as in\\r\\ndays gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he caught sight of Minerva\\r\\nand went straight to the gate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept\\r\\nwaiting for admittance. He took her right hand in his own, and bade her give\\r\\nhim her spear. “Welcome,” said he, “to our house, and when you have partaken of\\r\\nfood you shall tell us what you have come for.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were within he\\r\\ntook her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong bearing-post\\r\\nalong with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and he conducted her to\\r\\na richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask. There was a\\r\\nfootstool also for her feet,[2] and he set another seat near her for\\r\\nhimself, away from the suitors, that she might not be annoyed while eating by\\r\\ntheir noise and insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it\\r\\ninto a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table\\r\\nbeside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good\\r\\nthings of what there was in the house, the carver fetched them plates of all\\r\\nmanner of meats and set cups of gold by their side, and a manservant brought\\r\\nthem wine and poured it out for them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats.[3] Forthwith men\\r\\nservants poured water over their hands, maids went round with the\\r\\nbread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and they laid\\r\\ntheir hands upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had\\r\\nenough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning\\r\\nembellishments of a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they\\r\\ncompelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to\\r\\nsing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man\\r\\nmight hear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hope, sir,” said he, “that you will not be offended with what I am going to\\r\\nsay. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and all this is done\\r\\nat the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to\\r\\npowder in the surf. If these men were to see my father come back to Ithaca they\\r\\nwould pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse, for money would not\\r\\nserve them; but he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do\\r\\nsometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him\\r\\nagain. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come\\r\\nfrom. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how\\r\\nyour crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves to\\r\\nbe—for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want to know,\\r\\nare you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father’s time? In\\r\\nthe old days we had many visitors for my father went about much himself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Minerva answered, “I will tell you truly and particularly all about it. I\\r\\nam Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have come here\\r\\nwith my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for\\r\\nTemesa[4] with a\\r\\ncargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over\\r\\nyonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron[5] under the wooded\\r\\nmountain Neritum.[6]\\r\\nOur fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will\\r\\ngo and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and lives\\r\\nby himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him\\r\\nand get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering about his\\r\\nvineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was why I came,\\r\\nbut it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on\\r\\nthe mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or\\r\\na prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no\\r\\nprophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon\\r\\nme from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is\\r\\na man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find\\r\\nsome means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses\\r\\nreally have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully\\r\\nlike him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail\\r\\nfor Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have\\r\\nnever either of us seen the other.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mother,” answered Telemachus, “tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a\\r\\nwise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one who had\\r\\ngrown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more\\r\\nill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Minerva said, “There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope\\r\\nhas such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the\\r\\nmeaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about?\\r\\nHave you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family—for no one seems to\\r\\nbe bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests—how atrociously they are\\r\\nbehaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any\\r\\nrespectable person who comes near them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” said Telemachus, “as regards your question, so long as my father was\\r\\nhere it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure\\r\\nhave willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man\\r\\nwas ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if\\r\\nhe had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him\\r\\nwhen the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built\\r\\na mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but\\r\\nnow the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone\\r\\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but\\r\\ndismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father;\\r\\nheaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all\\r\\nour islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all\\r\\nthe principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of\\r\\npaying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will\\r\\nnot marry,[7] nor yet\\r\\nbring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long\\r\\nwill do so also with myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is that so?” exclaimed Minerva, “then you do indeed want Ulysses home again.\\r\\nGive him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he is the man he\\r\\nwas when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would\\r\\nsoon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more\\r\\nupon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to\\r\\nbeg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the\\r\\never-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some,\\r\\nfor he was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors\\r\\nwill have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take\\r\\nhis revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to set about\\r\\ntrying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean\\r\\nheroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your case before them, and call heaven\\r\\nto bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own\\r\\nplace, and if your mother’s mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to\\r\\nher father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage\\r\\ngifts that so dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon\\r\\nyou to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in\\r\\nquest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you\\r\\nsomething, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent\\r\\nmessage may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to\\r\\nSparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you\\r\\nhear that your father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the\\r\\nwaste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other\\r\\nhand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\\r\\nall due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again.\\r\\nThen, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means\\r\\nor foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead\\r\\ninfancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes’ praises\\r\\nfor having killed his father’s murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart\\r\\nlooking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now,\\r\\nhowever, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I\\r\\nkeep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember what\\r\\nI have said to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” answered Telemachus, “it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this\\r\\nway, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me; I know you\\r\\nwant to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have\\r\\ntaken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you a present, and you\\r\\nshall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value—a\\r\\nkeepsake such as only dear friends give to one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As\\r\\nfor any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and\\r\\nI will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I will give\\r\\nyou one of no less value in return.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given\\r\\nTelemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about his father. He\\r\\nfelt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so\\r\\nhe went straight to where the suitors were sitting.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the\\r\\nsad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid upon the\\r\\nAchaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from her room upstairs,\\r\\nand came down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her\\r\\nhandmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts\\r\\nthat supported the roof of the cloisters[8] with a staid maiden on either side of\\r\\nher. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Phemius,” she cried, “you know many another feat of gods and heroes, such as\\r\\npoets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink\\r\\ntheir wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful\\r\\nheart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and\\r\\nwhose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos.”[9]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mother,” answered Telemachus, “let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards\\r\\ndo not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes them, and\\r\\nwho sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure. This\\r\\nfellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people\\r\\nalways applaud the latest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear\\r\\nit; Ulysses is not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many another\\r\\nwent down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\r\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for\\r\\nspeech is man’s matter, and mine above all others [10]—for it is I who am master here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in her heart.\\r\\nThen, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear\\r\\nhusband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors were\\r\\nclamorous throughout the covered cloisters[11], and prayed each one that he might be\\r\\nher bed fellow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus spoke, “Shameless,” he cried, “and insolent suitors, let us\\r\\nfeast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a rare thing\\r\\nto hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in the morning meet\\r\\nme in full assembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at\\r\\none another’s houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on the other\\r\\nhand you choose to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove\\r\\nshall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father’s house there\\r\\nshall be no man to avenge you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the boldness of\\r\\nhis speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, “The gods seem to have\\r\\ngiven you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove never grant you to be\\r\\nchief in Ithaca as your father was before you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will\\r\\nbe chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of for me? It is no\\r\\nbad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honour. Still, now that\\r\\nUlysses is dead there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some\\r\\nother may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own\\r\\nhouse, and will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, “It rests with heaven to decide who\\r\\nshall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own house and over\\r\\nyour own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you\\r\\nviolence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want to know about this\\r\\nstranger. What country does he come from? Of what family is he, and where is\\r\\nhis estate? Has he brought you news about the return of your father, or was he\\r\\non business of his own? He seemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so\\r\\nsuddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My father is dead and gone,” answered Telemachus, “and even if some rumour\\r\\nreaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed sometimes send\\r\\nfor a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings no heed. As for\\r\\nthe stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old\\r\\nfriend of my father’s.” But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but\\r\\nwhen night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own\\r\\nabode.[12]\\r\\nTelemachus’s room was high up in a tower[13] that looked on to the outer court;\\r\\nhither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought. A good old woman,\\r\\nEuryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of\\r\\nblazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite\\r\\nyoung; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to\\r\\nher in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her\\r\\nto his bed for he feared his wife’s resentment.[14] She it was who now lighted Telemachus\\r\\nto his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house\\r\\ndid, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed\\r\\nroom and sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt[15] he gave it to the good old woman, who\\r\\nfolded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after\\r\\nwhich she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt\\r\\nhome by means of the strap.[16] But Telemachus as he lay covered with\\r\\na woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage and of\\r\\nthe counsel that Minerva had given him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK II\\n\\r\\nASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA—SPEECHES OF TELEMACHUS AND OF THE\\r\\nSUITORS—TELEMACHUS MAKES HIS PREPARATIONS AND STARTS FOR PYLOS WITH MINERVA\\r\\nDISGUISED AS MENTOR.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus rose and\\r\\ndressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword\\r\\nabout his shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal god. He at once\\r\\nsent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so they called them and\\r\\nthe people gathered thereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the\\r\\nplace of assembly spear in hand—not alone, for his two hounds went with him.\\r\\nMinerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all\\r\\nmarvelled at him as he went by, and when he took his place in his father’s seat\\r\\neven the oldest councillors made way for him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, was the\\r\\nfirst to speak. His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius, land of noble\\r\\nsteeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they were all shut up in the\\r\\ncave, and had cooked his last dinner for him.[17] He had three sons left, of whom two\\r\\nstill worked on their father’s land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the\\r\\nsuitors; nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and\\r\\nwas still weeping for him when he began his speech.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Men of Ithaca,” he said, “hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us there\\r\\nhas been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then can it be, whether\\r\\nold or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has he got wind of some\\r\\nhost approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some\\r\\nother matter of public moment? I am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope\\r\\nJove will grant him his heart’s desire.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he was\\r\\nbursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the assembly and\\r\\nthe good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to Aegyptius,\\r\\n“Sir,” said he, “it is I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened you, for\\r\\nit is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got wind of any host approaching\\r\\nabout which I would warn you, nor is there any matter of public moment on which\\r\\nI would speak. My grievance is purely personal, and turns on two great\\r\\nmisfortunes which have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of\\r\\nmy excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was like a\\r\\nfather to every one of you; the second is much more serious, and ere long will\\r\\nbe the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief men among you are\\r\\npestering my mother to marry them against her will. They are afraid to go to\\r\\nher father Icarius, asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide\\r\\nmarriage gifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my\\r\\nfather’s house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets,\\r\\nand never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No\\r\\nestate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm\\r\\nfrom our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my\\r\\ndays be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had\\r\\npower to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being\\r\\ndisgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to\\r\\npublic opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be\\r\\ndispleased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the\\r\\nbeginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave me\\r\\nsinglehanded[18]—unless it be that my brave father\\r\\nUlysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by\\r\\naiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house\\r\\nand home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I could then\\r\\ntake action against you to some purpose, and serve you with notices from house\\r\\nto house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy.”[19]\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears. Every\\r\\none was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no one ventured to make\\r\\nhim an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke thus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw the\\r\\nblame upon us suitors? It is your mother’s fault not ours, for she is a very\\r\\nartful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she had been driving us\\r\\nout of our minds, by encouraging each one of us, and sending him messages\\r\\nwithout meaning one word of what she says. And then there was that other trick\\r\\nshe played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work\\r\\non an enormous piece of fine needlework. ‘Sweet hearts,’ said she, ‘Ulysses is\\r\\nindeed dead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait—for I would\\r\\nnot have skill in needlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall for\\r\\nthe hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death shall take\\r\\nhim. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out\\r\\nwithout a pall.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her working on\\r\\nher great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by\\r\\ntorchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years and we never found her\\r\\nout, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth year, one of her maids\\r\\nwho knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing\\r\\nher work, so she had to finish it whether she would or no. The suitors,\\r\\ntherefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may\\r\\nunderstand—‘Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of\\r\\nher father’s choice’; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on\\r\\nplaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the\\r\\naccomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is so clever. We never\\r\\nyet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena, Mycene, and the\\r\\nfamous women of old, but they were nothing to your mother any one of them. It\\r\\nwas not fair of her to treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in\\r\\nthe mind with which heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating\\r\\nup your estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the\\r\\nhonour and glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that\\r\\nwe will not go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made\\r\\nher choice and married some one or other of us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me from my\\r\\nfather’s house? My father is abroad and we do not know whether he is alive or\\r\\ndead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the large sum which I must\\r\\ngive him if I insist on sending his daughter back to him. Not only will he deal\\r\\nrigorously with me, but heaven will also punish me; for my mother when she\\r\\nleaves the house will call on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not\\r\\nbe a creditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you\\r\\nchoose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one\\r\\nanother’s houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand,\\r\\nyou elect to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall\\r\\nreckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father’s house there shall be\\r\\nno man to avenge you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they flew on\\r\\nand on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly flight. When\\r\\nthey were right over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and circled about,\\r\\nbeating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of them that\\r\\nwere below; then, fighting fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off\\r\\ntowards the right over the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and\\r\\nasked each other what all this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best\\r\\nprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all\\r\\nhonesty, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors, for I\\r\\nsee mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away much longer;\\r\\nindeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them\\r\\nalone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let us then be wise in\\r\\ntime, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so\\r\\nof their own accord; it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying\\r\\nwithout due knowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when\\r\\nthe Argives set out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through\\r\\nmuch hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth\\r\\nyear and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, “Go home, old man, and prophesy to your\\r\\nown children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens myself much\\r\\nbetter than you can; birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or\\r\\nother, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has died in a far country, and it\\r\\nis a pity you are not dead along with him, instead of prating here about omens\\r\\nand adding fuel to the anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I\\r\\nsuppose you think he will give you something for your family, but I tell\\r\\nyou—and it shall surely be—when an old man like you, who should know better,\\r\\ntalks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his\\r\\nyoung friend will only fare so much the worse—he will take nothing by it, for\\r\\nthe suitors will prevent this—and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir,\\r\\nupon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon\\r\\nyou. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his\\r\\nmother back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all\\r\\nthe marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on\\r\\nharassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with\\r\\nall his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as\\r\\nmuch as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and\\r\\ncontinue to eat up Telemachus’s estate without paying him, till such time as\\r\\nhis mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe\\r\\nof expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare\\r\\nperfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in\\r\\ndue course, but for the way in which she treats us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus said, “Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no more,\\r\\nand entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of Ithaca now know my\\r\\nstory. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me hither and\\r\\nthither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in quest of my father who has so\\r\\nlong been missing. Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear\\r\\nthings in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of\\r\\nhim as alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will\\r\\nmake for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I\\r\\nwill return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a\\r\\nbarrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor[20] who had been a friend of Ulysses, and\\r\\nhad been left in charge of everything with full authority over the servants,\\r\\nrose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\\r\\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I hope\\r\\nthat all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not one\\r\\nof you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as though he were your father.\\r\\nI am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do violence in\\r\\nthe naughtiness of their hearts, and wager their heads that Ulysses will not\\r\\nreturn, they can take the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you\\r\\nothers I am shocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying\\r\\nto stop such scandalous goings on—which you could do if you chose, for you are\\r\\nmany and they are few.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, “Mentor, what folly is all\\r\\nthis, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing for one man\\r\\nto fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses himself were to set\\r\\nupon us while we are feasting in his house, and do his best to oust us, his\\r\\nwife, who wants him back so very badly, would have small cause for rejoicing,\\r\\nand his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds.\\r\\nThere is no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people\\r\\ngo about your business, and let his father’s old friends, Mentor and\\r\\nHalitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all—which I do not\\r\\nthink he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes\\r\\nand tells him something.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own abode,\\r\\nwhile the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the grey\\r\\nwaves, and prayed to Minerva.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” he cried, “you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the\\r\\nseas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I would obey you, but\\r\\nthe Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hindering me that I\\r\\ncannot do so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the\\r\\nvoice of Mentor. “Telemachus,” said she, “if you are made of the same stuff as\\r\\nyour father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Ulysses never\\r\\nbroke his word nor left his work half done. If, then, you take after him, your\\r\\nvoyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of\\r\\nPenelope in your veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom\\r\\nas good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as\\r\\nyou are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not\\r\\nentirely without some share of your father’s wise discernment, I look with hope\\r\\nupon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause with any of those\\r\\nfoolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to\\r\\ndeath and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that\\r\\nthey shall perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long\\r\\ndelayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a\\r\\nship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about\\r\\namong the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see\\r\\neverything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the\\r\\nstaff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat up\\r\\nvolunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I will run\\r\\nmy eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get her ready and\\r\\nwill put out to sea without delay.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in doing as\\r\\nthe goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the suitors flaying goats\\r\\nand singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came up to him at once and\\r\\nlaughed as he took his hand in his own, saying, “Telemachus, my fine\\r\\nfire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink\\r\\nwith us as you used to do. The Achaeans will find you in everything—a ship and\\r\\na picked crew to boot—so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news\\r\\nof your noble father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Antinous,” answered Telemachus, “I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of\\r\\nany kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that you should waste so\\r\\nmuch good property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am older and know\\r\\nmore about it, I am also stronger, and whether here among this people, or by\\r\\ngoing to Pylos, I will do you all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will\\r\\nnot be in vain—though, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of\\r\\nmy own, and must be passenger not captain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the others\\r\\nwent on getting dinner ready about the buildings,[21] jeering at him tauntingly as they did\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said one youngster, “means to be the death of us; I suppose he\\r\\nthinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again from Sparta, where\\r\\nhe seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as well, for poison to put in\\r\\nour wine and kill us?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother said, “Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be like his\\r\\nfather and perish far from his friends. In this case we should have plenty to\\r\\ndo, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the house we\\r\\ncan let his mother and the man who marries her have that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and spacious\\r\\nstore-room where his father’s treasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon\\r\\nthe floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open chests.\\r\\nHere, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, while casks of old,\\r\\nwell-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to drink, were ranged against\\r\\nthe wall in case Ulysses should come home again after all. The room was closed\\r\\nwith well-made doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old\\r\\nhouse-keeper Euryclea, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of\\r\\neverything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are keeping\\r\\nfor my father’s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should escape death, and\\r\\nfind his way home again after all. Let me have twelve jars, and see that they\\r\\nall have lids; also fill me some well-sewn leathern bags with barley meal—about\\r\\ntwenty measures in all. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing\\r\\nabout it. I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has\\r\\ngone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can\\r\\nhear anything about the return of my dear father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, “My\\r\\ndear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into your head? Where in\\r\\nthe world do you want to go to—you, who are the one hope of the house? Your\\r\\npoor father is dead and gone in some foreign country nobody knows where, and as\\r\\nsoon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you\\r\\nput out of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay\\r\\nwhere you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your\\r\\nlife out on the barren ocean.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fear not, nurse,” answered Telemachus, “my scheme is not without heaven’s\\r\\nsanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother, till\\r\\nI have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my having gone,\\r\\nand asks you; for I do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had\\r\\ncompleted her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and getting the\\r\\nbarley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and went\\r\\nround the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at the ship by\\r\\nsundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked him to let her have\\r\\na ship—which he was very ready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was\\r\\nover all the land, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board\\r\\nher that ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour.\\r\\nPresently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors into a deep\\r\\nslumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made them drop their cups\\r\\nfrom their hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine, they went back\\r\\ninto the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she\\r\\ntook the form and voice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said she, “the men are on board and at their oars, waiting for\\r\\nyou to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When they got\\r\\nto the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, and Telemachus said,\\r\\n“Now my men, help me to get the stores on board; they are all put together in\\r\\nthe cloister, and my mother does not know anything about it, nor any of the\\r\\nmaid servants except one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after. When they had\\r\\nbrought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board, Minerva going\\r\\nbefore him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel, while Telemachus sat\\r\\nbeside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and took their places on the\\r\\nbenches. Minerva sent them a fair wind from the West,[22] that whistled over the deep blue\\r\\nwaves[23] whereon\\r\\nTelemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as\\r\\nhe told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it,\\r\\nand made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted their white sails aloft\\r\\nwith ropes of twisted ox hide. As the sail bellied out with the wind, the ship\\r\\nflew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she\\r\\nsped onward. Then they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing\\r\\nbowls to the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from\\r\\neverlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night from dark\\r\\ntill dawn.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK III\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nbut as the sun was rising from the fair sea[24] into the firmament of heaven to shed\\r\\nlight on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the city of Neleus. Now the\\r\\npeople of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore to offer sacrifice of black\\r\\nbulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake. There were nine guilds with five\\r\\nhundred men in each, and there were nine bulls to each guild. As they were\\r\\neating the inward meats[25] and burning the thigh bones [on the\\r\\nembers] in the name of Neptune, Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their\\r\\nsails, brought their ship to anchor, and went ashore.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,\\r\\n“Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have taken this\\r\\nvoyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he came by his\\r\\nend; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he has got to tell us.\\r\\nBeg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no lies, for he is an excellent\\r\\nperson.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how, Mentor,” replied Telemachus, “dare I go up to Nestor, and how am I to\\r\\naddress him? I have never yet been used to holding long conversations with\\r\\npeople, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who is so much older than\\r\\nmyself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Some things, Telemachus,” answered Minerva, “will be suggested to you by your\\r\\nown instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am assured that the\\r\\ngods have been with you from the time of your birth until now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till they\\r\\nreached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were assembled. There\\r\\nthey found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company round him were busy\\r\\ngetting dinner ready, and putting pieces of meat on to the spits[26] while other\\r\\npieces were cooking. When they saw the strangers they crowded round them, took\\r\\nthem by the hand and bade them take their places. Nestor’s son Pisistratus at\\r\\nonce offered his hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins\\r\\nthat were lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then\\r\\nhe gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them into a\\r\\ngolden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting her at the same time.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Offer a prayer, sir,” said he, “to King Neptune, for it is his feast that you\\r\\nare joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink offering, pass the\\r\\ncup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that he too lifts his\\r\\nhands in prayer, for man cannot live without God in the world. Still he is\\r\\nyounger than you are, and is much of an age with myself, so I will give you the\\r\\nprecedence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and proper of\\r\\nhim to have given it to herself first;[27] she accordingly began praying\\r\\nheartily to Neptune. “O thou,” she cried, “that encirclest the earth, vouchsafe\\r\\nto grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon thee. More especially we\\r\\npray thee send down thy grace on Nestor and on his sons; thereafter also make\\r\\nthe rest of the Pylian people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they\\r\\nare offering you. Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect\\r\\nof the matter that has brought us in our ship to Pylos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to Telemachus and\\r\\nhe prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were roasted and had been\\r\\ntaken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his portion and they all made\\r\\nan excellent dinner. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor,\\r\\nknight of Gerene, began to speak.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said he, “that our guests have done their dinner, it will be best to ask\\r\\nthem who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and from what port have\\r\\nyou sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the seas as rovers with your hand\\r\\nagainst every man, and every man’s hand against you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask about his\\r\\nfather and get himself a good name.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nestor,” said he, “son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you ask whence\\r\\nwe come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under Neritum,[28] and the matter\\r\\nabout which I would speak is of private not public import. I seek news of my\\r\\nunhappy father Ulysses, who is said to have sacked the town of Troy in company\\r\\nwith yourself. We know what fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought\\r\\nat Troy, but as regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even\\r\\nthat he is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished,\\r\\nnor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid the\\r\\nwaves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if haply you may\\r\\nbe pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own\\r\\neyes, or heard it from some other traveller, for he was a man born to trouble.\\r\\nDo not soften things out of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness\\r\\nexactly what you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service,\\r\\neither by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear\\r\\nit in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” answered Nestor, “you recall a time of much sorrow to my mind, for\\r\\nthe brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while privateering under\\r\\nAchilles, and when fighting before the great city of king Priam. Our best men\\r\\nall of them fell there—Ajax, Achilles, Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and\\r\\nmy own dear son Antilochus, a man singularly fleet of foot and in fight\\r\\nvaliant. But we suffered much more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could\\r\\ntell the whole story? Though you were to stay here and question me for five\\r\\nyears, or even six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and\\r\\nyou would turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did\\r\\nwe try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us; during\\r\\nall this time there was no one who could compare with your father in\\r\\nsubtlety—if indeed you are his son—I can hardly believe my eyes—and you talk\\r\\njust like him too—no one would say that people of such different ages could\\r\\nspeak so much alike. He and I never had any kind of difference from first to\\r\\nlast neither in camp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose we\\r\\nadvised the Argives how all might be ordered for the best.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail in our\\r\\nships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex the Argives on their\\r\\nhomeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise or understanding, and\\r\\nhence many came to a bad end through the displeasure of Jove’s daughter\\r\\nMinerva, who brought about a quarrel between the two sons of Atreus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for it was\\r\\nsunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they explained why they had\\r\\ncalled the people together, it seemed that Menelaus was for sailing homeward at\\r\\nonce, and this displeased Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we\\r\\nhad offered hecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he\\r\\nmight have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have\\r\\nmade up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the two stood bandying\\r\\nhard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the\\r\\nair, and were of two minds as to what they should do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching mischief\\r\\nagainst us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into the water and put\\r\\nour goods with our women on board, while the rest, about half in number, stayed\\r\\nbehind with Agamemnon. We—the other half—embarked and sailed; and the ships\\r\\nwent well, for heaven had smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered\\r\\nsacrifices to the gods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however,\\r\\ndid not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the\\r\\ncourse of which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away\\r\\nunder Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the ships that\\r\\nwere with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was brewing. The son of\\r\\nTydeus went on also with me, and his crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined\\r\\nus at Lesbos, and found us making up our minds about our course—for we did not\\r\\nknow whether to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our\\r\\nleft, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we asked\\r\\nheaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest\\r\\nout of danger if we headed our ships across the open sea to Euboea. This we\\r\\ntherefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during\\r\\nthe night to Geraestus,[29] where we offered many sacrifices to\\r\\nNeptune for having helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed and his\\r\\nmen stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never\\r\\nfell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything about the\\r\\nothers. I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost but, as in duty\\r\\nbound, I will give you without reserve the reports that have reached me since I\\r\\nhave been here in my own house. They say the Myrmidons returned home safely\\r\\nunder Achilles’ son Neoptolemus; so also did the valiant son of Poias,\\r\\nPhiloctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his followers who\\r\\nescaped death in the field got safe home with him to Crete. No matter how far\\r\\nout of the world you live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he\\r\\ncame to at the hands of Aegisthus—and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus\\r\\npresently pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him\\r\\nto do as Orestes did, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble\\r\\nfather. You too, then—for you are a tall smart-looking fellow—show your mettle\\r\\nand make yourself a name in story.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nestor son of Neleus,” answered Telemachus, “honour to the Achaean name, the\\r\\nAchaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all time for he has\\r\\navenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant me to do like vengeance\\r\\non the insolence of the wicked suitors, who are ill treating me and plotting my\\r\\nruin; but the gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father, so\\r\\nwe must bear it as best we may.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” said Nestor, “now that you remind me, I remember to have heard\\r\\nthat your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards you and are\\r\\nmaking havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely, or are public\\r\\nfeeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows but what Ulysses may\\r\\ncome back after all, and pay these scoundrels in full, either single-handed or\\r\\nwith a force of Achaeans behind him? If Minerva were to take as great a liking\\r\\nto you as she did to Ulysses when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet\\r\\nsaw the gods so openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if\\r\\nshe would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would soon\\r\\nsome of them forget their wooing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far too\\r\\nmuch to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though the gods\\r\\nthemselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Minerva said, “Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven has a\\r\\nlong arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I should not care\\r\\nhow much I suffered before getting home, provided I could be safe when I was\\r\\nonce there. I would rather this, than get home quickly, and then be killed in\\r\\nmy own house as Agamemnon was by the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife.\\r\\nStill, death is certain, and when a man’s hour is come, not even the gods can\\r\\nsave him, no matter how fond they are of him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mentor,” answered Telemachus, “do not let us talk about it any more. There is\\r\\nno chance of my father’s ever coming back; the gods have long since counselled\\r\\nhis destruction. There is something else, however, about which I should like to\\r\\nask Nestor, for he knows much more than any one else does. They say he has\\r\\nreigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell\\r\\nme, therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that\\r\\nway? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far\\r\\nbetter a man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging\\r\\nelsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you truly,” answered Nestor, “and indeed you have yourself divined\\r\\nhow it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had found Aegisthus\\r\\nstill alive in his house, there would have been no barrow heaped up for him,\\r\\nnot even when he was dead, but he would have been thrown outside the city to\\r\\ndogs and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a\\r\\ndeed of great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and\\r\\nAegisthus, who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled\\r\\nAgamemnon’s wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a\\r\\ngood natural disposition;[30] moreover there was a bard with her,\\r\\nto whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy, that he was\\r\\nto keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled her destruction,\\r\\nAegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows\\r\\nand seagulls to batten upon—after which she went willingly enough to the house\\r\\nof Aegisthus. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated\\r\\nmany temples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his\\r\\nexpectations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms with\\r\\none another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens, Apollo with\\r\\nhis painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaus’ ship (and never\\r\\nman knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) so that he died then\\r\\nand there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press\\r\\nforward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral\\r\\nrites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far\\r\\nas the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard\\r\\ntill the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one\\r\\nhalf towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the\\r\\nriver Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea\\r\\nfrom a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as\\r\\nPhaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but after\\r\\nPhaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great\\r\\nshelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked;\\r\\nbut the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships,\\r\\nthey were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold\\r\\nand substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home\\r\\nplotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled\\r\\nin Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year\\r\\nOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his\\r\\nfather. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false\\r\\nAegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus\\r\\ncame home,[31] with\\r\\nas much treasure as his ships could carry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far from home,\\r\\nnor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat\\r\\nup everything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand.\\r\\nStill, I should advise you by all means to go and visit Menelaus, who has\\r\\nlately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope\\r\\nto get back from, when the winds had once carried him so far out of his\\r\\nreckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, so vast and\\r\\nterrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and\\r\\ntake your own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have\\r\\na chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to\\r\\nLacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will\\r\\ntell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, “Sir, all\\r\\nthat you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of the victims to\\r\\nbe cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Neptune, and the other\\r\\nimmortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed time. People should go away early\\r\\nand not keep late hours at a religious festival.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants\\r\\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls\\r\\nwith wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink\\r\\noffering; then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire, and stood\\r\\nup to make their drink offerings. When they had made their offerings and had\\r\\ndrunk each as much as he was minded, Minerva and Telemachus were for going on\\r\\nboard their ship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Heaven and the immortal gods,” he exclaimed, “forbid that you should leave my\\r\\nhouse to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes,\\r\\nor that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both\\r\\nfor myself and for my guests? Let me tell you I have store both of rugs and\\r\\ncloaks, and shall not permit the son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on\\r\\nthe deck of a ship—not while I live—nor yet will my sons after me, but they\\r\\nwill keep open house as I have done.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva answered, “Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better\\r\\nthat Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall return with\\r\\nyou and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew, and\\r\\nkeep them in good heart. I am the only older person among them; the rest are\\r\\nall young men of Telemachus’ own age, who have taken this voyage out of\\r\\nfriendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I\\r\\nmust go to the Cauconians where I have a large sum of money long owing to me.\\r\\nAs for Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a\\r\\nchariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him\\r\\nwith your best and fleetest horses.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all\\r\\nmarvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus by the\\r\\nhand. “My friend,” said he, “I see that you are going to be a great hero some\\r\\nday, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young. This can\\r\\nhave been none other of those who dwell in heaven than Jove’s redoubtable\\r\\ndaughter, the Trito-born, who shewed such favour towards your brave father\\r\\namong the Argives. Holy queen,” he continued, “vouchsafe to send down thy grace\\r\\nupon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in\\r\\nsacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought\\r\\nby man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in\\r\\nsacrifice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to his own\\r\\nhouse, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got there and had\\r\\ntaken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine\\r\\nthat was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that\\r\\nheld it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings to\\r\\nMinerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink\\r\\nofferings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to\\r\\nbed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that\\r\\nwas over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now\\r\\nleft him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the\\r\\nqueen his wife by his side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left his\\r\\ncouch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble that stood\\r\\nin front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but\\r\\nhe was now dead, and had gone to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat\\r\\nsceptre in hand, as guardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their\\r\\nrooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and\\r\\nThrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them\\r\\nthey made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My sons,” said he, “make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first and\\r\\nforemost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested herself\\r\\nvisibly to me during yesterday’s festivities. Go, then, one or other of you to\\r\\nthe plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here with it\\r\\nat once. Another must go to Telemachus’ ship, and invite all the crew, leaving\\r\\ntwo men only in charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus\\r\\nthe goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where\\r\\nyou are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to\\r\\nfetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me\\r\\nsome clear spring water.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was brought in\\r\\nfrom the plain, and Telemachus’s crew came from the ship; the goldsmith brought\\r\\nthe anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and Minerva\\r\\nherself came to accept the sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith\\r\\ngilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have pleasure in their\\r\\nbeauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched\\r\\nwater from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his\\r\\nother hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a\\r\\nsharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor\\r\\nbegan with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered\\r\\nmany a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from the heifer’s head upon the\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal[32] Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and\\r\\nbrought the heifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the base\\r\\nof her neck, whereon the daughters and daughters in law of Nestor, and his\\r\\nvenerable wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with\\r\\ndelight. Then they lifted the heifer’s head from off the ground, and\\r\\nPisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they\\r\\ncut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round\\r\\nin two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then\\r\\nNestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young\\r\\nmen stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were\\r\\nburned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up\\r\\nsmall, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor’s youngest daughter, washed Telemachus. When\\r\\nshe had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him a fair mantle and\\r\\nshirt,[33] and he\\r\\nlooked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of\\r\\nNestor. When the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat\\r\\ndown to dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept\\r\\npouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had enough to\\r\\neat and drink Nestor said, “Sons, put Telemachus’s horses to the chariot that\\r\\nhe may start at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet horses\\r\\nto the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision of bread, wine, and\\r\\nsweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus got into the chariot,\\r\\nwhile Pisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed\\r\\nthe horses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country, leaving\\r\\nthe high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying\\r\\nthe yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the\\r\\nland. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\\r\\nand grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained\\r\\nthem hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they\\r\\nagain yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing\\r\\ngatehouse.[34]\\r\\nPisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently\\r\\nthey came to the corn lands of the open country, and in the course of time\\r\\ncompleted their journey, so well did their steeds take them.[35]\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK IV\\n\\r\\nTHE VISIT TO KING MENELAUS, WHO TELLS HIS STORY—MEANWHILE THE SUITORS IN ITHACA\\r\\nPLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nthey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove straight to the\\r\\nabode of Menelaus[36] [and found him in his own house,\\r\\nfeasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son, and also\\r\\nof his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior\\r\\nAchilles. He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was still\\r\\nat Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending\\r\\nher with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles’\\r\\nson was reigning. For his only son he had found a bride from Sparta,[37] the daughter of\\r\\nAlector. This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven\\r\\nvouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as\\r\\ngolden Venus herself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making merry in his\\r\\nhouse. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two\\r\\ntumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with\\r\\nhis tune.[38]\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate, whereon\\r\\nEteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying\\r\\nback into the house to tell his Master. He went close up to him and said,\\r\\n“Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two men, who look like sons of\\r\\nJove. What are we to do? Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find\\r\\nfriends elsewhere as they best can?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus was very angry and said, “Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never used to\\r\\nbe a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses out, of course,\\r\\nand show the strangers in that they may have supper; you and I have staid often\\r\\nenough at other people’s houses before we got back here, where heaven grant\\r\\nthat we may rest in peace henceforward.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him. They took\\r\\ntheir sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to the mangers, and\\r\\ngave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned the chariot against\\r\\nthe end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into the house. Telemachus and\\r\\nPisistratus were astonished when they saw it, for its splendour was as that of\\r\\nthe sun and moon; then, when they had admired everything to their heart’s\\r\\ncontent, they went into the bath room and washed themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they brought them\\r\\nwoollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by the side of\\r\\nMenelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and\\r\\npoured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a\\r\\nclean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them\\r\\nmany good things of what there was in the house, while the carver fetched them\\r\\nplates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, “Fall to, and welcome; when you have done\\r\\nsupper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as you cannot have\\r\\nbeen lost. You must be descended from a line of sceptre-bearing kings, for poor\\r\\npeople do not have such sons as you are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he handed them[39] a piece of fat roast loin, which had\\r\\nbeen set near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good\\r\\nthings that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\\r\\nTelemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close that no one might\\r\\nhear, “Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see the gleam of bronze and\\r\\ngold—of amber,[40]\\r\\nivory, and silver. Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace\\r\\nof Olympian Jove. I am lost in admiration.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus overheard him and said, “No one, my sons, can hold his own with Jove,\\r\\nfor his house and everything about him is immortal; but among mortal men—well,\\r\\nthere may be another who has as much wealth as I have, or there may not; but at\\r\\nall events I have travelled much and have undergone much hardship, for it was\\r\\nnearly eight years before I could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus,\\r\\nPhoenicia and the Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and\\r\\nthe Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are\\r\\nborn, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that country,\\r\\nwhether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes\\r\\nyield all the year round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches\\r\\namong these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the\\r\\nperfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all\\r\\nthis wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all\\r\\nthis, and of my heavy loss in the ruin[41] of a stately mansion fully and\\r\\nmagnificently furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so\\r\\nthat I had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain\\r\\nof Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and\\r\\nall of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again,\\r\\nfor crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I\\r\\nmay, I do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him\\r\\nwithout loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one\\r\\nof all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing\\r\\nby it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long\\r\\ntime, and we know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his\\r\\nlong-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left behind him\\r\\nan infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought him of\\r\\nhis father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned, so that he\\r\\nheld his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaus saw this he\\r\\ndoubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at\\r\\nonce and find what it was all about.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted and\\r\\nperfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought her a seat,\\r\\nAlcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the silver work-box which\\r\\nAlcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which\\r\\nis the richest city in the whole world; he gave Menelaus two baths, both of\\r\\npure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife\\r\\ngave Helen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work\\r\\nbox that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed\\r\\nthis by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet\\r\\ncoloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her\\r\\nfeet upon the footstool, and began to question her husband.[42]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do we know, Menelaus,” said she, “the names of these strangers who have come\\r\\nto visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?—but I cannot help saying what I\\r\\nthink. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like somebody else (indeed\\r\\nwhen I look at him I hardly know what to think) as this young man is like\\r\\nTelemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to\\r\\nTroy with battle in your hearts, on account of my most shameless self.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear wife,” replied Menelaus, “I see the likeness just as you do. His hands\\r\\nand feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair, with the shape of his head and\\r\\nthe expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking about Ulysses, and\\r\\nsaying how much he had suffered on my account, tears fell from his eyes, and he\\r\\nhid his face in his mantle.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Pisistratus said, “Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in thinking that\\r\\nthis young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and is ashamed to come\\r\\nhere and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation is so divinely\\r\\ninteresting as your own. My father, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for\\r\\nhe wanted to know whether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son\\r\\nhas always trouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without\\r\\nsupporters; and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent,\\r\\nand there is no one among his own people to stand by him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Bless my heart,” replied Menelaus, “then I am receiving a visit from the son\\r\\nof a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake. I had always\\r\\nhoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when heaven had granted us\\r\\na safe return from beyond the seas. I should have founded a city for him in\\r\\nArgos, and built him a house. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his\\r\\ngoods, his son, and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of\\r\\nthe neighbouring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seen one\\r\\nanother continually, and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and\\r\\nhappy an intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great\\r\\ngood fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept, Telemachus\\r\\nwept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his eyes from filling,\\r\\nwhen he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom the son of bright Dawn had\\r\\nkilled. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me you\\r\\nwere a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be possible, do\\r\\nas I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am getting my supper.\\r\\nMorning will come in due course, and in the forenoon I care not how much I cry\\r\\nfor those that are dead and gone. This is all we can do for the poor things. We\\r\\ncan only shave our heads for them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a\\r\\nbrother who died at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure\\r\\nto have known him—his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself,\\r\\nbut they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your discretion, my friend,” answered Menelaus, “is beyond your years. It is\\r\\nplain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is son to one\\r\\nwhom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring—and it has blessed\\r\\nNestor from first to last all his days, giving him a green old age in his own\\r\\nhouse, with sons about him who are both well disposed and valiant. We will put\\r\\nan end therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water\\r\\nbe poured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in\\r\\nthe morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands and they\\r\\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jove’s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged the\\r\\nwine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour. Whoever\\r\\ndrinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day, not\\r\\neven though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees a\\r\\nbrother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes. This drug, of such\\r\\nsovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon,\\r\\na woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into\\r\\nthe mixing bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country\\r\\nis a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put\\r\\nthis drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable men\\r\\n(which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil, and can do\\r\\nwhat he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale in\\r\\nseason. I cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I\\r\\ncan say what he did when he was before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts\\r\\nof difficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself\\r\\nall in rags, and entered the enemy’s city looking like a menial or a beggar,\\r\\nand quite different from what he did when he was among his own people. In this\\r\\ndisguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone\\r\\nrecognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me. When,\\r\\nhowever, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I\\r\\nhad sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got safely\\r\\nback to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant\\r\\nto do. He killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the\\r\\nArgive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my\\r\\nown part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I\\r\\nwas unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,\\r\\naway from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by\\r\\nno means deficient either in person or understanding.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Menelaus said, “All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is true. I\\r\\nhave travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but I have never seen\\r\\nsuch another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and what courage he displayed\\r\\nwithin the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest of the Argives were lying in\\r\\nwait to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans.[43] At that moment you came up to us;\\r\\nsome god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had\\r\\nDeiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place and pat\\r\\nit; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked all our\\r\\nwives—Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside heard what a noise you made.\\r\\nDiomed and I could not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there,\\r\\nor to answer you from inside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite\\r\\nstill, all except Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses\\r\\nclapped his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this\\r\\nthat saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How sad,” exclaimed Telemachus, “that all this was of no avail to save him,\\r\\nnor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us all to bed,\\r\\nthat we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was in the\\r\\ngatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top\\r\\nof them with woollen cloaks for the guests to wear. So the maids went out,\\r\\ncarrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a man-servant presently conducted\\r\\nthe strangers. Thus, then, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the\\r\\nforecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by\\r\\nhis side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose and\\r\\ndressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword\\r\\nabout his shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal god. Then,\\r\\ntaking a seat near Telemachus he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to Lacedaemon?\\r\\nAre you on public, or private business? Tell me all about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have come, sir,” replied Telemachus, “to see if you can tell me anything\\r\\nabout my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate is\\r\\nbeing wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing great numbers\\r\\nof my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their addresses to my mother.\\r\\nTherefore, I am suppliant at your knees if haply you may tell me about my\\r\\nfather’s melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it\\r\\nfrom some other traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften\\r\\nthings out of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what\\r\\nyou saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word\\r\\nor deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as\\r\\nin my favour and tell me truly all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. “So,” he exclaimed, “these\\r\\ncowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind might as well lay her new born\\r\\nyoung in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some\\r\\ngrassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short work with\\r\\nthe pair of them—and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove,\\r\\nMinerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled\\r\\nwith Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans\\r\\ncheered him—if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they would\\r\\nhave a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I\\r\\nwill not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all\\r\\nthat the old man of the sea told me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for my\\r\\nhecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very strict\\r\\nabout having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship can sail in a\\r\\nday with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island called Pharos—it\\r\\nhas a good harbour from which vessels can get out into open sea when they have\\r\\ntaken in water—and here the gods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a\\r\\nbreath of fair wind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of\\r\\nprovisions and my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon\\r\\nme and saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of\\r\\nthe sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the men used\\r\\nto go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope of catching a\\r\\nfish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger. ‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘it\\r\\nseems to me that you like starving in this way—at any rate it does not greatly\\r\\ntrouble you, for you stick here day after day, without even trying to get away\\r\\nthough your men are dying by inches.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Let me tell you,’ said I, ‘whichever of the goddesses you may happen to be,\\r\\nthat I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have offended the gods\\r\\nthat live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods know everything, which of\\r\\nthe immortals it is that is hindering me in this way, and tell me also how I\\r\\nmay sail the sea so as to reach my home.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stranger,’ replied she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. There is an\\r\\nold immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is Proteus. He\\r\\nis an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is Neptune’s head man and\\r\\nknows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him\\r\\nand hold him tight, he will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to\\r\\ntake, and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also\\r\\ntell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house both good\\r\\nand bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Can you show me,’ said I, ‘some stratagem by means of which I may catch this\\r\\nold god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a god is not easily\\r\\ncaught—not by a mortal man.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. About the time\\r\\nwhen the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the sea comes up\\r\\nfrom under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the water over his\\r\\nhead. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to sleep in a great sea\\r\\ncave, where the seals—Halosydne’s chickens as they call them—come up also from\\r\\nthe grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and\\r\\nfish-like smell do they bring with them. [44] Early to-morrow morning I will take\\r\\nyou to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three\\r\\nbest men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the\\r\\nold man will play you.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he has seen\\r\\nthem and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep among them, as a\\r\\nshepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is asleep seize him; put\\r\\nforth all your strength and hold him fast, for he will do his very utmost to\\r\\nget away from you. He will turn himself into every kind of creature that goes\\r\\nupon the earth, and will become also both fire and water; but you must hold him\\r\\nfast and grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes\\r\\nback to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your\\r\\nhold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry\\r\\nwith you, and what you must do to reach your home over the seas.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the place\\r\\nwhere my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was clouded with care\\r\\nas I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper ready, for night was\\r\\nfalling, and camped down upon the beach.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I took the three men on\\r\\nwhose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went along by the sea-side,\\r\\npraying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess fetched me up four seal skins\\r\\nfrom the bottom of the sea, all of them just skinned, for she meant playing a\\r\\ntrick upon her father. Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to\\r\\nwait till we should come up. When we were close to her, she made us lie down in\\r\\nthe pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our\\r\\nambuscade would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was\\r\\nmost distressing[45]—who would go to bed with a sea\\r\\nmonster if he could help it?—but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought\\r\\nof something that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each\\r\\nman’s nostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.[46]\\n\\n\\r\\n“We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the seals come\\r\\nup in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the old man of the sea\\r\\ncame up too, and when he had found his fat seals he went over them and counted\\r\\nthem. We were among the first he counted, and he never suspected any guile, but\\r\\nlaid himself down to sleep as soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon\\r\\nhim with a shout and seized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks,\\r\\nand changed himself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden\\r\\nhe became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running\\r\\nwater, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck to him and never\\r\\nlost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became distressed, and said,\\r\\n‘Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that hatched this plot with you for\\r\\nsnaring me and seizing me against my will? What do you want?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You know that yourself, old man,’ I answered, ‘you will gain nothing by\\r\\ntrying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in this island,\\r\\nand see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing all heart; tell me,\\r\\nthen, for you gods know everything, which of the immortals it is that is\\r\\nhindering me, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my home?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then,’ he said, ‘if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly, you\\r\\nmust offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before embarking; for\\r\\nit is decreed that you shall not get back to your friends, and to your own\\r\\nhouse, till you have returned to the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered\\r\\nholy hecatombs to the immortal gods that reign in heaven. When you have done\\r\\nthis they will let you finish your voyage.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long and\\r\\nterrible voyage to Egypt;[47] nevertheless, I answered, ‘I will do\\r\\nall, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nwhether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we set sail from\\r\\nTroy have got home safely, or whether any one of them came to a bad end either\\r\\non board his own ship or among his friends when the days of his fighting were\\r\\ndone.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Son of Atreus,’ he answered, ‘why ask me? You had better not know what I can\\r\\ntell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard my story. Many of\\r\\nthose about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many still remain, and only two\\r\\nof the chief men among the Achaeans perished during their return home. As for\\r\\nwhat happened on the field of battle—you were there yourself. A third Achaean\\r\\nleader is still at sea, alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked,\\r\\nfor Neptune drove him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him\\r\\nget safe out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva’s hatred he would have\\r\\nescaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the gods could\\r\\nnot drown him even though they had tried to do so, and when Neptune heard this\\r\\nlarge talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny hands, and split the rock\\r\\nof Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained where it was, but the part on which\\r\\nAjax was sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he\\r\\ndrank salt water and was drowned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but when he was\\r\\njust about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught by a heavy gale\\r\\nwhich carried him out to sea again sorely against his will, and drove him to\\r\\nthe foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but where Aegisthus was then living.\\r\\nBy and by, however, it seemed as though he was to return safely after all, for\\r\\nthe gods backed the wind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon\\r\\nAgamemnon kissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in\\r\\nhis own country.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and to whom\\r\\nhe had promised two talents of gold. This man had been looking out for a whole\\r\\nyear to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the slip and prepare war;\\r\\nwhen, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by, he went and told Aegisthus, who\\r\\nat once began to lay a plot for him. He picked twenty of his bravest warriors\\r\\nand placed them in ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite\\r\\nside he prepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to\\r\\nAgamemnon, and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him\\r\\nthere, all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when\\r\\nthe banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles; not\\r\\none of Agamemnon’s followers was left alive, nor yet one of Aegisthus’, but\\r\\nthey were all killed there in the cloisters.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat down upon\\r\\nthe sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear to live nor look\\r\\nupon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had my fill of weeping and\\r\\nwrithing upon the ground, the old man of the sea said, ‘Son of Atreus, do not\\r\\nwaste any more time in crying so bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find\\r\\nyour way home as fast as ever you can, for Aegisthus may be still alive, and\\r\\neven though Orestes has been beforehand with you in killing him, you may yet\\r\\ncome in for his funeral.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, ‘I know, then,\\r\\nabout these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of whom you spoke; is\\r\\nhe still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? or is he dead? Tell me, no\\r\\nmatter how much it may grieve me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The third man,’ he answered, ‘is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I can see him\\r\\nin an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who is\\r\\nkeeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for he has no ships nor\\r\\nsailors to take him over the sea. As for your own end, Menelaus, you shall not\\r\\ndie in Argos, but the gods will take you to the Elysian plain, which is at the\\r\\nends of the world. There fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an\\r\\neasier life than any where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not\\r\\nrain, nor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings\\r\\nsoftly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This will happen to you\\r\\nbecause you have married Helen, and are Jove’s son-in-law.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the ships with\\r\\nmy companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went along. When we\\r\\nreached the ships we got supper ready, for night was falling, and camped down\\r\\nupon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew\\r\\nour ships into the water, and put our masts and sails within them; then we went\\r\\non board ourselves, took our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with\\r\\nour oars. I again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and\\r\\noffered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased\\r\\nheaven’s anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon that his name\\r\\nmight live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for the gods sent\\r\\nme a fair wind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now for yourself—stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I will then\\r\\nspeed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a chariot and three\\r\\nhorses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice that so long as you live you\\r\\nmay think of me whenever you make a drink-offering to the immortal gods.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Son of Atreus,” replied Telemachus, “do not press me to stay longer; I should\\r\\nbe contented to remain with you for another twelve months; I find your\\r\\nconversation so delightful that I should never once wish myself at home with my\\r\\nparents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos are already impatient, and you\\r\\nare detaining me from them. As for any present you may be disposed to make me,\\r\\nI had rather that it should be a piece of plate. I will take no horses back\\r\\nwith me to Ithaca, but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have\\r\\nmuch flat ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also meadow-sweet and\\r\\nwheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas in\\r\\nIthaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country is more fit\\r\\nfor goats than horses, and I like it the better for that. [48] None of our\\r\\nislands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus’s hand within his own. “What you say,” said\\r\\nhe, “shows that you come of good family. I both can, and will, make this\\r\\nexchange for you, by giving you the finest and most precious piece of plate in\\r\\nall my house. It is a mixing bowl by Vulcan’s own hand, of pure silver, except\\r\\nthe rim, which is inlaid with gold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it\\r\\nme in the course of a visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my\\r\\nhomeward journey. I will make you a present of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king’s house. They\\r\\nbrought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for them to take\\r\\nwith them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the courts].[49]\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark on\\r\\nthe levelled ground in front of Ulysses’ house, and were behaving with all\\r\\ntheir old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who were their ringleaders and\\r\\nmuch the foremost among them all, were sitting together when Noemon son of\\r\\nPhronius came up and said to Antinous,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos? He has\\r\\na ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have twelve brood mares\\r\\nthere with yearling mule foals by their side not yet broken in, and I want to\\r\\nbring one of them over here and break him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that\\r\\nTelemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was only away\\r\\nsomewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the swineherd; so\\r\\nAntinous said, “When did he go? Tell me truly, and what young men did he take\\r\\nwith him? Were they freemen or his own bondsmen—for he might manage that too?\\r\\nTell me also, did you let him have the ship of your own free will because he\\r\\nasked you, or did he take it without your leave?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I lent it him,” answered Noemon, “what else could I do when a man of his\\r\\nposition said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige him? I could not\\r\\npossibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were the best young men we\\r\\nhave, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain—or some god who was exactly like\\r\\nhim. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning,\\r\\nand yet he was then setting out for Pylos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNoemon then went back to his father’s house, but Antinous and Eurymachus were\\r\\nvery angry. They told the others to leave off playing, and to come and sit down\\r\\nalong with themselves. When they came, Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke in\\r\\nanger. His heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we had made\\r\\nsure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow has got away in spite\\r\\nof us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving us trouble presently; may\\r\\nJove take him before he is full grown. Find me a ship, therefore, with a crew\\r\\nof twenty men, and I will lie in wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and\\r\\nSamos; he will then rue the day that he set out to try and get news of his\\r\\nfather.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all of them\\r\\nwent inside the buildings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were plotting; for a\\r\\nman servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the outer court as they were\\r\\nlaying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress. As he crossed the\\r\\nthreshold of her room Penelope said: “Medon, what have the suitors sent you\\r\\nhere for? Is it to tell the maids to leave their master’s business and cook\\r\\ndinner for them? I wish they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither\\r\\nhere nor anywhere else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you\\r\\nall make of my son’s estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were\\r\\nchildren, how good Ulysses had been to them—never doing anything high-handed,\\r\\nnor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they may\\r\\ntake a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did an unjust\\r\\nthing by anybody—which shows what bad hearts you have, and that there is no\\r\\nsuch thing as gratitude left in this world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Medon said, “I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are plotting\\r\\nsomething much more dreadful now—may heaven frustrate their design. They are\\r\\ngoing to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming home from Pylos and\\r\\nLacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope’s heart sank within her, and for a long time she was speechless;\\r\\nher eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance. At last, however,\\r\\nshe said, “Why did my son leave me? What business had he to go sailing off in\\r\\nships that make long voyages over the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want to\\r\\ndie without leaving any one behind him to keep up his name?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know,” answered Medon, “whether some god set him on to it, or whether\\r\\nhe went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his father was dead,\\r\\nor alive and on his way home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief. There\\r\\nwere plenty of seats in the house, but she had no heart for sitting on any one\\r\\nof them; she could only fling herself on the floor of her own room and cry;\\r\\nwhereon all the maids in the house, both old and young, gathered round her and\\r\\nbegan to cry too, till at last in a transport of sorrow she exclaimed,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction than any\\r\\nother woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and lion-hearted\\r\\nhusband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over\\r\\nall Hellas and middle Argos, and now my darling son is at the mercy of the\\r\\nwinds and waves, without my having heard one word about his leaving home. You\\r\\nhussies, there was not one of you would so much as think of giving me a call\\r\\nout of my bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I\\r\\nhad known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give it up, no\\r\\nmatter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse behind him—one or\\r\\nother. Now, however, go some of you and call old Dolius, who was given me by my\\r\\nfather on my marriage, and who is my gardener. Bid him go at once and tell\\r\\neverything to Laertes, who may be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public\\r\\nsympathy on our side, as against those who are trying to exterminate his own\\r\\nrace and that of Ulysses.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, “You may kill me, Madam, or let me live\\r\\non in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the real truth. I\\r\\nknew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in the way of bread and\\r\\nwine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I would not tell you anything for\\r\\nsome ten or twelve days, unless you asked or happened to hear of his having\\r\\ngone, for he did not want you to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam,\\r\\nwash your face, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer\\r\\nprayers to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even\\r\\nthough he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has trouble\\r\\nenough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the race of the son\\r\\nof Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him, and\\r\\ninherit both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the tears\\r\\nfrom her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and went upstairs\\r\\nwith her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a basket and began\\r\\npraying to Minerva.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” she cried, “Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. If ever\\r\\nUlysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or heifer, bear\\r\\nit in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son from the villainy of\\r\\nthe suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer; meanwhile the\\r\\nsuitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister, and one of them said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us. Little does\\r\\nshe dream that her son has now been doomed to die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen. Then\\r\\nAntinous said, “Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest some of it get\\r\\ncarried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence, about which we are all of\\r\\na mind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then chose twenty men, and they went down to their ship and to the sea side;\\r\\nthey drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and sails inside her; they\\r\\nbound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due\\r\\ncourse, and spread the white sails aloft, while their fine servants brought\\r\\nthem their armour. Then they made the ship fast a little way out, came on shore\\r\\nagain, got their suppers, and waited till night should fall.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink, and wondering\\r\\nwhether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the wicked suitors.\\r\\nLike a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming her in on every side\\r\\nshe thought and thought till she sank into a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft\\r\\nof thought and motion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the likeness\\r\\nof Penelope’s sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had married Eumelus and\\r\\nlived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to the house of Ulysses, and to make\\r\\nPenelope leave off crying, so it came into her room by the hole through which\\r\\nthe thong went for pulling the door to, and hovered over her head saying,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer you to\\r\\nweep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will yet come back\\r\\nto you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,\\r\\n“Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I suppose that\\r\\nis because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to leave off crying and\\r\\nrefrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me? I, who have lost my brave\\r\\nand lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose\\r\\nname was great over all Hellas and middle Argos; and now my darling son has\\r\\ngone off on board of a ship—a foolish fellow who has never been used to\\r\\nroughing it, nor to going about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious\\r\\nabout him than about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him,\\r\\nlest something should happen to him, either from the people among whom he has\\r\\ngone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting against him, and are\\r\\nbent on killing him before he can return home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the vision said, “Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There is one\\r\\ngone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand by his side, I\\r\\nmean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you, and who has sent me to\\r\\nbear you this message.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then,” said Penelope, “if you are a god or have been sent here by divine\\r\\ncommission, tell me also about that other unhappy one—is he still alive, or is\\r\\nhe already dead and in the house of Hades?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the vision said, “I shall not tell you for certain whether he is alive or\\r\\ndead, and there is no use in idle conversation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated into\\r\\nthin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted, so vivid\\r\\nhad been her dream.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent\\r\\non murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great\\r\\nsize, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and there is a harbour on either\\r\\nside of it where a ship can lie. Here then the Achaeans placed themselves in\\r\\nambush.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK V\\n\\r\\nCALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus—harbinger of light alike\\r\\nto mortals and immortals—the gods met in council and with them, Jove the lord\\r\\nof thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to tell them of the many\\r\\nsufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph\\r\\nCalypso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” said she, “and all you other gods that live in everlasting\\r\\nbliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed ruler\\r\\nany more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will be all henceforth\\r\\ncruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects but has forgotten\\r\\nUlysses, who ruled them as though he were their father. There he is, lying in\\r\\ngreat pain in an island where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him\\r\\ngo; and he cannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships\\r\\nnor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying\\r\\nto murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and\\r\\nLacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news of his father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What, my dear, are you talking about?” replied her father, “did you not send\\r\\nhim there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses to get home and\\r\\npunish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to protect Telemachus, and\\r\\nto see him safely home again, while the suitors have to come hurry-skurrying\\r\\nback without having killed him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, “Mercury, you are our\\r\\nmessenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor Ulysses is\\r\\nto return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men, but after a\\r\\nperilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach fertile Scheria,[50] the land of the\\r\\nPhaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he\\r\\nwere one of ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and\\r\\nwill give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back\\r\\nfrom Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home without disaster.\\r\\nThis is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his\\r\\nfriends.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as he was\\r\\ntold. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could\\r\\nfly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals men’s\\r\\neyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand\\r\\nover Pieria; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the\\r\\nlevel of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing\\r\\nevery hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the\\r\\nspray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the\\r\\nisland which was his journey’s end, he left the sea and went on by land till he\\r\\ncame to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and one\\r\\ncould smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood. As for\\r\\nherself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden shuttle through the warp\\r\\nand singing beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder,\\r\\npoplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds had\\r\\nbuilt their nests—owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy their\\r\\nbusiness in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew\\r\\nluxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of\\r\\nwater in channels cut pretty close together, and turned hither and thither so\\r\\nas to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed.\\r\\n[51] Even a god\\r\\ncould not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still\\r\\nand looked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went inside the\\r\\ncave.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso knew him at once—for the gods all know each other, no matter how far\\r\\nthey live from one another—but Ulysses was not within; he was on the sea-shore\\r\\nas usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears in his eyes, groaning\\r\\nand breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave Mercury a seat and said: “Why\\r\\nhave you come to see me, Mercury—honoured, and ever welcome—for you do not\\r\\nvisit me often? Say what you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and\\r\\nif it can be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed him\\r\\nsome red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough, and then\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I have come\\r\\nhere, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove sent me; it was\\r\\nno doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all this way over the sea\\r\\nwhere there are no cities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice\\r\\nhecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross\\r\\nJove, nor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the most\\r\\nill-starred of all those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam\\r\\nand sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On their way home\\r\\nthey sinned against Minerva,[52] who raised both wind and waves\\r\\nagainst them, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was\\r\\ncarried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are to let this man go at\\r\\nonce, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people,\\r\\nbut shall return to his house and country and see his friends again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, “You gods,” she exclaimed,\\r\\n“ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and hate seeing a\\r\\ngoddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open matrimony. So\\r\\nwhen rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious gods were all of you\\r\\nfurious till Diana went and killed him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in\\r\\nlove with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove\\r\\ncame to hear of it before so very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts.\\r\\nAnd now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor\\r\\ncreature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with\\r\\nlightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he\\r\\nhimself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him and\\r\\ncherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal, so that he should\\r\\nnever grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels\\r\\nto nothing; therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas\\r\\nagain; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men\\r\\nwho can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good\\r\\nfaith, as will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then send him away,” said Mercury, “or Jove will be angry with you and punish\\r\\nyou”.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, for she\\r\\nhad heard Jove’s message. She found him sitting upon the beach with his eyes\\r\\never filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness; for he had got tired\\r\\nof Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it\\r\\nwas she, not he, that would have it so. As for the day time, he spent it on the\\r\\nrocks and on the sea shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always\\r\\nlooking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out\\r\\nany longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go, cut some\\r\\nbeams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may\\r\\ncarry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, and water on board to\\r\\nsave you from starving. I will also give you clothes, and will send you a fair\\r\\nwind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so will it—for they know more\\r\\nabout these things, and can settle them better than I can.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. “Now goddess,” he answered, “there is\\r\\nsomething behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home when\\r\\nyou bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not even a well\\r\\nfound ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing\\r\\nthat you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft unless you first\\r\\nsolemnly swear that you mean me no mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: “You know a great deal,”\\r\\nsaid she, “but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above and earth below be my\\r\\nwitnesses, with the waters of the river Styx—and this is the most solemn oath\\r\\nwhich a blessed god can take—that I mean you no sort of harm, and am only\\r\\nadvising you to do exactly what I should do myself in your place. I am dealing\\r\\nwith you quite straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very\\r\\nsorry for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\\r\\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till they\\r\\ncame to Calypso’s cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury had just left.\\r\\nCalypso set meat and drink before him of the food that mortals eat; but her\\r\\nmaids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and they laid their hands on the\\r\\ngood things that were before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat\\r\\nand drink, Calypso spoke, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own land at\\r\\nonce? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how much suffering is\\r\\nin store for you before you get back to your own country, you would stay where\\r\\nyou are, keep house along with me, and let me make you immortal, no matter how\\r\\nanxious you may be to see this wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the\\r\\ntime day after day; yet I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or\\r\\nwell-looking than she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman\\r\\nshould compare in beauty with an immortal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Goddess,” replied Ulysses, “do not be angry with me about this. I am quite\\r\\naware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful as\\r\\nyourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal. Nevertheless, I\\r\\nwant to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me when I\\r\\nam on the sea, I will bear it and make the best of it. I have had infinite\\r\\ntrouble both by land and sea already, so let this go with the rest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into the\\r\\ninner part of the cave and went to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on his shirt\\r\\nand cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer fabric, very fine\\r\\nand graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her waist and a veil to\\r\\ncover her head. She at once set herself to think how she could speed Ulysses on\\r\\nhis way. So she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was\\r\\nsharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on\\r\\nto it. She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\\r\\nthe island where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar and pine, that reached\\r\\nthe sky—very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water.[53] Then, when she\\r\\nhad shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut\\r\\nthem, which he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed\\r\\nthem smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile\\r\\nCalypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the\\r\\ntimbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\\r\\nshipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the\\r\\nribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and\\r\\na rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a\\r\\nprotection against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and\\r\\nby Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made these too,\\r\\nexcellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the\\r\\nhelp of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso sent him\\r\\nfrom the island after washing him and giving him some clean clothes. She gave\\r\\nhim a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger one of water; she also\\r\\ngave him a wallet full of provisions, and found him in much good meat.\\r\\nMoreover, she made the wind fair and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses\\r\\nspread his sail before it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means\\r\\nof the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on\\r\\nlate-setting Bootes, and on the Bear—which men also call the wain, and which\\r\\nturns round and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into\\r\\nthe stream of Oceanus—for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days\\r\\nseven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines\\r\\nof the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared, rising\\r\\nlike a shield on the horizon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of\\r\\nUlysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see him\\r\\nsailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his head and\\r\\nmuttered to himself, saying, “Good heavens, so the gods have been changing\\r\\ntheir minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia, and now he is close to\\r\\nthe land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he shall escape from the\\r\\ncalamities that have befallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet\\r\\nbefore he has done with it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred it round\\r\\nin the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till earth, sea, and\\r\\nsky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. Winds from\\r\\nEast, South, North, and West fell upon him all at the same time, and a\\r\\ntremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses’ heart began to fail him. “Alas,” he\\r\\nsaid to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of me? I am afraid\\r\\nCalypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea before I got back\\r\\nhome. It is all coming true. How black is Jove making heaven with his clouds,\\r\\nand what a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe\\r\\nto perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in\\r\\nthe cause of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when\\r\\nthe Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for\\r\\nthen I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured my name;\\r\\nbut now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft reeled\\r\\nagain, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go the helm, and the\\r\\nforce of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast half way up, and\\r\\nboth sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long time Ulysses was under\\r\\nwater, and it was all he could do to rise to the surface again, for the clothes\\r\\nCalypso had given him weighed him down; but at last he got his head above water\\r\\nand spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In\\r\\nspite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast\\r\\nas he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to\\r\\nescape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds\\r\\nwhirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though the South,\\r\\nNorth, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it\\r\\nat once.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called Leucothea, saw\\r\\nhim. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since raised to the rank\\r\\nof a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Ulysses now was, she had\\r\\ncompassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat\\r\\nupon the raft.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor good man,” said she, “why is Neptune so furiously angry with you? He\\r\\nis giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster he will not kill\\r\\nyou. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid you; strip, leave your\\r\\nraft to drive before the wind, and swim to the Phaeacian coast where better\\r\\nluck awaits you. And here, take my veil and put it round your chest; it is\\r\\nenchanted, and you can come to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you\\r\\ntouch land take it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then\\r\\ngo away again.” With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then\\r\\nshe dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. “Alas,” he said to himself in his\\r\\ndismay, “this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring me to ruin by\\r\\nadvising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at present, for the\\r\\nland where she said I should be quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good\\r\\nway off. I know what I will do—I am sure it will be best—no matter what happens\\r\\nI will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when the sea\\r\\nbreaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that seemed\\r\\nto rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft, which then\\r\\nwent to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed about by a\\r\\nwhirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on\\r\\nhorseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino’s veil\\r\\nunder his arms, and plunged into the sea—meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune\\r\\nwatched him as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying,\\r\\n“There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do\\r\\npeople. I do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too\\r\\nlightly.” On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his palace is.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the winds\\r\\nexcept one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good stiff breeze\\r\\nfrom the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses reached the land of the\\r\\nPhaeacians where he would be safe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with a heavy\\r\\nswell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the third day\\r\\nbroke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much as a breath of\\r\\nair stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see\\r\\nland quite near. Then, as children rejoice when their dear father begins to get\\r\\nbetter after having for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some\\r\\nangry spirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when\\r\\nhe again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might\\r\\nonce more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he\\r\\nbegan to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still\\r\\nbroke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray;\\r\\nthere were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but\\r\\nonly headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses’ heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to himself,\\r\\n“Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I had given up all\\r\\nhope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is rocky and surf-beaten,\\r\\nthe rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with deep water close under\\r\\nthem so that I cannot climb out for want of foot hold. I am afraid some great\\r\\nwave will lift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the\\r\\nwater—which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim\\r\\nfurther in search of some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me\\r\\nout to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster\\r\\nof the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that\\r\\nNeptune is very angry with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such force\\r\\nagainst the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to pieces if Minerva\\r\\nhad not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the rock with both hands and\\r\\nclung to it groaning with pain till the wave retired, so he was saved that\\r\\ntime; but presently the wave came on again and carried him back with it far\\r\\ninto the sea—tearing his hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some\\r\\none plucks it from its bed, and the stones come up along with it—even so did\\r\\nthe rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep\\r\\ndown under the water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his own\\r\\ndestiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him. He swam\\r\\nseaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against the land, and\\r\\nat the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see if he could find some\\r\\nhaven, or a spit that should take the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on,\\r\\nhe came to the mouth of a river, and here he thought would be the best place,\\r\\nfor there were no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that\\r\\nthere was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the sea-god\\r\\nNeptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost his way has at\\r\\nall times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my distress I draw near to\\r\\nyour stream, and cling to the knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O\\r\\nking, for I declare myself your suppliant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm before\\r\\nhim, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here at last Ulysses’\\r\\nknees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had completely broken him. His\\r\\nbody was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils ran down like a river with\\r\\nsea-water, so that he could neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from\\r\\nsheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came to himself\\r\\nagain, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the\\r\\nsalt[54] stream of\\r\\nthe river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that bore it\\r\\ntowards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and\\r\\nkissed the bounteous earth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” he cried to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of me, and\\r\\nhow is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through the long\\r\\nwatches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may make\\r\\nan end of me—for towards sunrise there will be a keen wind blowing from off the\\r\\nriver. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods,\\r\\nand sleep in some thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night’s rest,\\r\\nbut some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one upon some\\r\\nhigh ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath two shoots of olive\\r\\nthat grew from a single stock—the one an ungrafted sucker, while the other had\\r\\nbeen grafted. No wind, however squally, could break through the cover they\\r\\nafforded, nor could the sun’s rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them,\\r\\nso closely did they grow into one another. Ulysses crept under these and began\\r\\nto make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves\\r\\nlying about—enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard winter\\r\\nweather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down and heaped the\\r\\nleaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any\\r\\nneighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having\\r\\nto get a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and\\r\\nMinerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\\r\\nall memories of his sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VI\\n\\r\\nTHE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off to the\\r\\ncountry and city of the Phaeacians—a people who used to live in the fair town\\r\\nof Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes were stronger than\\r\\nthey and plundered them, so their king Nausithous moved them thence and settled\\r\\nthem in Scheria, far from all other people. He surrounded the city with a wall,\\r\\nbuilt houses and temples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was\\r\\ndead and gone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were\\r\\ninspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in\\r\\nfurtherance of the return of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there slept a\\r\\ngirl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King Alcinous. Two\\r\\nmaid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty, one on either side of\\r\\nthe doorway, which was closed with well made folding doors. Minerva took the\\r\\nform of the famous sea captain Dymas’s daughter, who was a bosom friend of\\r\\nNausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl’s bedside like a\\r\\nbreath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy daughter?\\r\\nHere are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are going to be married\\r\\nalmost immediately, and should not only be well dressed yourself, but should\\r\\nfind good clothes for those who attend you. This is the way to get yourself a\\r\\ngood name, and to make your father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that\\r\\nwe make tomorrow a washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you\\r\\nso that you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best\\r\\nyoung men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going to\\r\\nremain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a waggon and\\r\\nmules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and girdles, and you\\r\\ncan ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the\\r\\nwashing-cisterns are some way from the town.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say is the\\r\\neverlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and neither rain nor\\r\\nsnow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great\\r\\npeacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and\\r\\never. This was the place to which the goddess went when she had given\\r\\ninstructions to the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about her dream;\\r\\nshe therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her father and mother\\r\\nall about it, and found them in their own room. Her mother was sitting by the\\r\\nfireside spinning her purple yarn with her maids around her, and she happened\\r\\nto catch her father just as he was going out to attend a meeting of the town\\r\\ncouncil, which the Phaeacian aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want to take\\r\\nall our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the chief man here,\\r\\nso it is only right that you should have a clean shirt when you attend meetings\\r\\nof the council. Moreover, you have five sons at home, two of them married,\\r\\nwhile the other three are good looking bachelors; you know they always like to\\r\\nhave clean linen when they go to a dance, and I have been thinking about all\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to, but her\\r\\nfather knew and said, “You shall have the mules, my love, and whatever else you\\r\\nhave a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall get you a good strong\\r\\nwaggon with a body to it that will hold all your clothes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out, harnessed\\r\\nthe mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes down from the\\r\\nlinen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother prepared her a basket of\\r\\nprovisions with all sorts of good things, and a goat skin full of wine; the\\r\\ngirl now got into the waggon, and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of\\r\\noil, that she and her women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and\\r\\nreins and lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered\\r\\non the road. They pulled without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa and\\r\\nher wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they reached the water side they went to the washing cisterns, through\\r\\nwhich there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any quantity of linen,\\r\\nno matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules and turned them out to\\r\\nfeed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the water side. They took the\\r\\nclothes out of the waggon, put them in the water, and vied with one another in\\r\\ntreading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After they had washed them and\\r\\ngot them quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had\\r\\nraised a high beach of shingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing\\r\\nthemselves with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the\\r\\nstream, and waited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done\\r\\ndinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to play at\\r\\nball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes forth upon the\\r\\nmountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer, and the wood\\r\\nnymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sport along with her (then\\r\\nis Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a full head taller than the others,\\r\\nand eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so did the girl\\r\\noutshine her handmaids.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the clothes and\\r\\nputting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider how Ulysses should wake\\r\\nup and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him to the city of the\\r\\nPhaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one of the maids, which missed\\r\\nher and fell into deep water. On this they all shouted, and the noise they made\\r\\nwoke Ulysses, who sat up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might\\r\\nall be.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” said he to himself, “what kind of people have I come amongst? Are they\\r\\ncruel, savage, and uncivilised, or hospitable and humane? I seem to hear the\\r\\nvoices of young women, and they sound like those of the nymphs that haunt\\r\\nmountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. At any rate I\\r\\nam among a race of men and women. Let me try if I cannot manage to get a look\\r\\nat them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough covered\\r\\nwith thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some lion of the\\r\\nwilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and defying both wind and\\r\\nrain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is\\r\\nfamished, and will dare break even into a well fenced homestead, trying to get\\r\\nat the sheep—even such did Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to\\r\\nthem all naked as he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt\\r\\nand so begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits that\\r\\njutted out into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm, for Minerva\\r\\nput courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She stood right in\\r\\nfront of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he should go up to her, throw himself\\r\\nat her feet, and embrace her knees as a suppliant, or stay where he was and\\r\\nentreat her to give him some clothes and show him the way to the town. In the\\r\\nend he deemed it best to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should\\r\\ntake offence at his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her\\r\\nin honeyed and persuasive language.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“O queen,” he said, “I implore your aid—but tell me, are you a goddess or are\\r\\nyou a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, I can only\\r\\nconjecture that you are Jove’s daughter Diana, for your face and figure\\r\\nresemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a mortal and live on\\r\\nearth, thrice happy are your father and mother—thrice happy, too, are your\\r\\nbrothers and sisters; how proud and delighted they must feel when they see so\\r\\nfair a scion as yourself going out to a dance; most happy, however, of all will\\r\\nhe be whose wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes you to his own\\r\\nhome. I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost\\r\\nin admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young palm tree\\r\\nwhich I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of Apollo—for I was\\r\\nthere, too, with much people after me, when I was on that journey which has\\r\\nbeen the source of all my troubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out\\r\\nof the ground as that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I now\\r\\nadmire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great\\r\\ndistress; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon\\r\\nthe sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian\\r\\nisland,[55] and now\\r\\nfate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure still further suffering;\\r\\nfor I do not think that I have yet come to the end of it, but rather that\\r\\nheaven has still much evil in store for me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I have met,\\r\\nand I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to your town, and let\\r\\nme have anything that you may have brought hither to wrap your clothes in. May\\r\\nheaven grant you in all things your heart’s desire—husband, house, and a happy,\\r\\npeaceful home; for there is nothing better in this world than that man and wife\\r\\nshould be of one mind in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts\\r\\nof their friends glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Nausicaa answered, “Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\\r\\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives prosperity to\\r\\nrich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what he has seen fit to send\\r\\nyou, and make the best of it. Now, however, that you have come to this our\\r\\ncountry, you shall not want for clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner\\r\\nin distress may reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and\\r\\nwill tell you the name of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am\\r\\ndaughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she called her maids and said, “Stay where you are, you girls. Can you not\\r\\nsee a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a robber or a\\r\\nmurderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do us Phaeacians any\\r\\nharm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a land’s end that juts\\r\\ninto the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with any other people. This is\\r\\nonly some poor man who has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for\\r\\nstrangers and foreigners in distress are under Jove’s protection, and will take\\r\\nwhat they can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to\\r\\neat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from\\r\\nthe wind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another back.\\r\\nThey made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told them, and\\r\\nbrought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the little golden cruse of\\r\\noil, and told him to go and wash in the stream. But Ulysses said, “Young women,\\r\\nplease to stand a little on one side that I may wash the brine from my\\r\\nshoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long enough since my skin has\\r\\nhad a drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing\\r\\nthere. I am ashamed to strip[56] before a number of good looking young\\r\\nwomen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses washed\\r\\nhimself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and from his broad\\r\\nshoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had got the brine out of\\r\\nhis hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put on the clothes which the girl\\r\\nhad given him; Minerva then made him look taller and stronger than before, she\\r\\nalso made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls\\r\\nlike hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a\\r\\nskilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva\\r\\nenriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it—and his work is full of beauty.\\r\\nThen he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young\\r\\nand handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to her\\r\\nmaids:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who live in\\r\\nheaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw him I thought him\\r\\nplain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods who dwell in heaven. I\\r\\nshould like my future husband to be just such another as he is, if he would\\r\\nonly stay here and not want to go away. However, give him something to eat and\\r\\ndrink.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and drank\\r\\nravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind. Meanwhile,\\r\\nNausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen folded and placed\\r\\nin the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took her seat, she called\\r\\nUlysses:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” said she, “rise and let us be going back to the town; I will\\r\\nintroduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell you that\\r\\nyou will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians. But be sure and do as I\\r\\nbid you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as we are going past the\\r\\nfields and farm lands, follow briskly behind the waggon along with the maids\\r\\nand I will lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to the town,\\r\\nwhere you will find a high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on\\r\\neither side with a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn\\r\\nup by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You\\r\\nwill see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and\\r\\npaved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship’s gear of\\r\\nall kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars\\r\\nare made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know nothing\\r\\nabout bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their\\r\\nmasts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far over the sea.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against me later\\r\\non; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low fellow, if he met\\r\\nus, might say, ‘Who is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with\\r\\nNausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps\\r\\nhe is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we\\r\\nhave no neighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to\\r\\nher prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It\\r\\nwould be a good thing if she would take herself off and find a husband\\r\\nsomewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young\\r\\nPhaeacians who are in love with her.’ This is the kind of disparaging remark\\r\\nthat would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be\\r\\nscandalised at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in\\r\\nspite of everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without\\r\\nhaving been married in the face of all the world.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help you home,\\r\\ndo as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by the road side\\r\\ndedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow all round it. Here my\\r\\nfather has a field of rich garden ground, about as far from the town as a man’s\\r\\nvoice will carry. Sit down there and wait for a while till the rest of us can\\r\\nget into the town and reach my father’s house. Then, when you think we must\\r\\nhave done this, come into the town and ask the way to the house of my father\\r\\nAlcinous. You will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it\\r\\nout to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine\\r\\nhouse as he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer court,\\r\\ngo right across the inner court till you come to my mother. You will find her\\r\\nsitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is a fine\\r\\nsight to see her as she leans back against one of the bearing-posts with her\\r\\nmaids all ranged behind her. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on\\r\\nwhich he sits and topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my\\r\\nmother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you\\r\\ncan gain her over, you may hope to see your own country again, no matter how\\r\\ndistant it may be.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river. The mules\\r\\ndrew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road. She was careful not\\r\\nto go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were following on foot along with\\r\\nthe waggon, so she plied her whip with judgement. As the sun was going down\\r\\nthey came to the sacred grove of Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed\\r\\nto the mighty daughter of Jove.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” he cried, “daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, hear me now,\\r\\nfor you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking me. Now,\\r\\ntherefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends and be\\r\\nhospitably received by the Phaeacians.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show herself\\r\\nto him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, who was still furious\\r\\nin his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VII\\n\\r\\nRECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the town. When\\r\\nshe reached her father’s house she drew up at the gateway, and her\\r\\nbrothers—comely as the gods—gathered round her, took the mules out of the\\r\\nwaggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she went to her own room,\\r\\nwhere an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit the fire for her. This old\\r\\nwoman had been brought by sea from Apeira, and had been chosen as a prize for\\r\\nAlcinous because he was king over the Phaeacians, and the people obeyed him as\\r\\nthough he were a god.[57] She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and\\r\\nhad now lit the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into her own room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a thick mist\\r\\nall round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaeacians who met him\\r\\nshould be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he was just entering the\\r\\ntown, she came towards him in the likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher.\\r\\nShe stood right in front of him, and Ulysses said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous? I am an\\r\\nunfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your town and\\r\\ncountry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva said, “Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you want,\\r\\nfor Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before you and show\\r\\nthe way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look at any man, nor ask him\\r\\nquestions; for the people here cannot abide strangers, and do not like men who\\r\\ncome from some other place. They are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by\\r\\nthe grace of Neptune in ships that glide along like thought, or as a bird in\\r\\nthe air.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one of the\\r\\nPhaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the midst of them;\\r\\nfor the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards him had hidden him in a\\r\\nthick cloud of darkness. He admired their harbours, ships, places of assembly,\\r\\nand the lofty walls of the city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were\\r\\nvery striking, and when they reached the king’s house Minerva said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you. You will\\r\\nfind a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be afraid; go\\r\\nstraight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to carry his point,\\r\\neven though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her name is Arete, and she\\r\\ncomes of the same family as her husband Alcinous. They both descend originally\\r\\nfrom Neptune, who was father to Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great\\r\\nbeauty. Periboea was the youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time\\r\\nreigned over the giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own\\r\\nlife to boot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the great\\r\\nNausithous, who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two sons Rhexenor\\r\\nand Alcinous;[58]\\r\\nApollo killed the first of them while he was still a bridegroom and without\\r\\nmale issue; but he left a daughter Arete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as\\r\\nno other woman is honoured of all those that keep house along with their\\r\\nhusbands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her children, by\\r\\nAlcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon her as a goddess, and\\r\\ngreet her whenever she goes about the city, for she is a thoroughly good woman\\r\\nboth in head and heart, and when any women are friends of hers, she will help\\r\\ntheir husbands also to settle their disputes. If you can gain her good will,\\r\\nyou may have every hope of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back\\r\\nto your home and country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to Marathon[59] and to the\\r\\nspacious streets of Athens, where she entered the abode of Erechtheus; but\\r\\nUlysses went on to the house of Alcinous, and he pondered much as he paused a\\r\\nwhile before reaching the threshold of bronze, for the splendour of the palace\\r\\nwas like that of the sun or moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from\\r\\nend to end, and the cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung\\r\\non pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was\\r\\nsilver and the hook of the door was of gold.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with his\\r\\nconsummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the palace of king\\r\\nAlcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old. Seats were ranged all\\r\\nalong the wall, here and there from one end to the other, with coverings of\\r\\nfine woven work which the women of the house had made. Here the chief persons\\r\\nof the Phaeacians used to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all\\r\\nseasons; and there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in\\r\\ntheir hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those who were at\\r\\ntable. There are[60] fifty maid servants in the house,\\r\\nsome of whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others\\r\\nwork at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards\\r\\nlike the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that\\r\\nit will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so their\\r\\nwomen excel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them all manner of\\r\\nuseful arts, and they are very intelligent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about four acres\\r\\nwith a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees—pears, pomegranates,\\r\\nand the most delicious apples. There are luscious figs also, and olives in full\\r\\ngrowth. The fruits never rot nor fail all the year round, neither winter nor\\r\\nsummer, for the air is so soft that a new crop ripens before the old has\\r\\ndropped. Pear grows on pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with\\r\\nthe grapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part\\r\\nof this, the grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\\r\\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on have shed\\r\\ntheir blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again are just changing\\r\\ncolour. In the furthest part of the ground there are beautifully arranged beds\\r\\nof flowers that are in bloom all the year round. Two streams go through it, the\\r\\none turned in ducts throughout the whole garden, while the other is carried\\r\\nunder the ground of the outer court to the house itself, and the town’s people\\r\\ndraw water from it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the gods had\\r\\nendowed the house of king Alcinous.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he had looked\\r\\nlong enough he crossed the threshold and went within the precincts of the\\r\\nhouse. There he found all the chief people among the Phaeacians making their\\r\\ndrink offerings to Mercury, which they always did the last thing before going\\r\\naway for the night.[61] He went straight through the court,\\r\\nstill hidden by the cloak of darkness in which Minerva had enveloped him, till\\r\\nhe reached Arete and King Alcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of\\r\\nthe queen, and at that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he\\r\\nbecame visible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\\r\\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Queen Arete,” he exclaimed, “daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress I\\r\\nhumbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom may heaven\\r\\nprosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave their possessions to\\r\\ntheir children, and all the honours conferred upon them by the state) to help\\r\\nme home to my own country as soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble\\r\\nand away from my friends.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their peace,\\r\\ntill presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent speaker and an elder\\r\\namong the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alcinous,” said he, “it is not creditable to you that a stranger should be\\r\\nseen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to hear what\\r\\nyou are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat on a stool inlaid\\r\\nwith silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and water that we may make a\\r\\ndrink offering to Jove the lord of thunder, who takes all well disposed\\r\\nsuppliants under his protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper,\\r\\nof whatever there may be in the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from the\\r\\nhearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting beside\\r\\nhim, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him water in a\\r\\nbeautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for him to wash his\\r\\nhands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper servant brought him\\r\\nbread and offered him many good things of what there was in the house, and\\r\\nUlysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one of the servants, “Pontonous,\\r\\nmix a cup of wine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove\\r\\nthe lord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man\\r\\nhis drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and had drunk each as\\r\\nmuch as he was minded, Alcinous said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You have had\\r\\nyour supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall invite a still\\r\\nlarger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial banquet in honour of our\\r\\nguest; we can then discuss the question of his escort, and consider how we may\\r\\nat once send him back rejoicing to his own country without trouble or\\r\\ninconvenience to himself, no matter how distant it may be. We must see that he\\r\\ncomes to no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once at home he\\r\\nwill have to take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other\\r\\npeople. It is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who\\r\\nhas come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are departing\\r\\nfrom their usual practice, for hitherto they have made themselves perfectly\\r\\nclear to us when we have been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at our\\r\\nfeasts just like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to\\r\\nstumble upon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment, for we are\\r\\nas near of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.”[62]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said: “Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into your head.\\r\\nI have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body nor mind, and most\\r\\nresemble those among you who are the most afflicted. Indeed, were I to tell you\\r\\nall that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me, you would say that I was still\\r\\nworse off than they are. Nevertheless, let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an\\r\\nempty stomach is a very importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man’s notice\\r\\nno matter how dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that\\r\\nI shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell\\r\\nonly on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\\r\\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content to die\\r\\nif I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all the greatness\\r\\nof my house.”[63]\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he should\\r\\nhave his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when they had made\\r\\ntheir drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded they went\\r\\nhome to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Ulysses in the cloister with\\r\\nArete and Alcinous while the servants were taking the things away after supper.\\r\\nArete was the first to speak, for she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good\\r\\nclothes that Ulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so\\r\\nshe said, “Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should\\r\\nlike to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\\r\\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate in full\\r\\nthe tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me;\\r\\nbut as regards your question, there is an island far away in the sea which is\\r\\ncalled ‘the Ogygian.’ Here dwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso,\\r\\ndaughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far from all neighbours human or\\r\\ndivine. Fortune, however, brought me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for\\r\\nJove struck my ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My\\r\\nbrave comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was\\r\\ncarried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\\r\\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the\\r\\ngreat goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me with the utmost\\r\\nkindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I might never grow old,\\r\\nbut she could not persuade me to let her do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\\r\\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last when the\\r\\neighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will, either because\\r\\nJove had told her she must, or because she had changed her mind. She sent me\\r\\nfrom her island on a raft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and\\r\\nwine. Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew\\r\\nboth warm and fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the\\r\\neighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your\\r\\ncoast—and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still\\r\\nmuch trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no\\r\\nfurther, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that\\r\\nI could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the\\r\\ngale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your\\r\\nshores.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the waves\\r\\ndashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam on till I came\\r\\nto a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for there were no rocks\\r\\nand it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I got out of the water and\\r\\ngathered my senses together again. Night was coming on, so I left the river,\\r\\nand went into a thicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and\\r\\npresently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I\\r\\nslept among the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when\\r\\nI woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter’s maid servants playing\\r\\nupon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\\r\\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than\\r\\ncould be expected from so young a person—for young people are apt to be\\r\\nthoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had had me\\r\\nwashed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you see me. Now,\\r\\ntherefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Alcinous said, “Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to bring\\r\\nyou on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she was the first\\r\\nperson whose aid you asked.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray do not scold her,” replied Ulysses; “she is not to blame. She did tell me\\r\\nto follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid, for I thought you\\r\\nmight perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human being is sometimes a\\r\\nlittle suspicious and irritable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” replied Alcinous, “I am not the kind of man to get angry about\\r\\nnothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove, Minerva, and\\r\\nApollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how much you think as I\\r\\ndo, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and become my son-in-law. If\\r\\nyou will stay I will give you a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid)\\r\\nshall keep you here against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I\\r\\nwill attend tomorrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep[64] during the whole\\r\\nvoyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to\\r\\nyour own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further off\\r\\nthan Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow-haired\\r\\nRhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any\\r\\nplace—and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing\\r\\nthemselves, and came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\\r\\nexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, “Father Jove, grant that\\r\\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable name\\r\\namong mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that\\r\\nwas in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to spread coverlets\\r\\non the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to wear. The maids thereon\\r\\nwent out with torches in their hands, and when they had made the bed they came\\r\\nup to Ulysses and said, “Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is\\r\\nready,” and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\\r\\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by his\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VIII\\n\\r\\nBANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous and\\r\\nUlysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place of assembly,\\r\\nwhich was near the ships. When they got there they sat down side by side on a\\r\\nseat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form of one of Alcinous’\\r\\nservants, and went round the town in order to help Ulysses to get home. She\\r\\nwent up to the citizens, man by man, and said, “Aldermen and town councillors\\r\\nof the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger\\r\\nwho has just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks\\r\\nlike an immortal god.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the\\r\\nassembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one was struck\\r\\nwith the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him about the head\\r\\nand shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he\\r\\nmight impress the Phaeacians favourably as being a very remarkable man, and\\r\\nmight come off well in the many trials of skill to which they would challenge\\r\\nhim. Then, when they were got together, Alcinous spoke:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” said he, “aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, that I\\r\\nmay speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be, has found his\\r\\nway to my house from somewhere or other either East or West. He wants an escort\\r\\nand wishes to have the matter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we\\r\\nhave done for others before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house\\r\\nhas been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us\\r\\ndraw a ship into the sea—one that has never yet made a voyage—and man her with\\r\\ntwo and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your\\r\\noars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to prepare a\\r\\nfeast.[65] I will\\r\\nfind you in everything. I am giving these instructions to the young men who\\r\\nwill form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will\\r\\njoin me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and\\r\\nwe will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he\\r\\nmay choose to sing about.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a servant went\\r\\nto fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to the sea shore as they\\r\\nhad been told, and when they got there they drew the ship into the water, got\\r\\nher mast and sails inside her, bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted\\r\\nthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft. They\\r\\nmoored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went\\r\\nto the house of King Alcinous. The out houses,[66] yards, and all the precincts were\\r\\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and Alcinous\\r\\nkilled them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen. These they\\r\\nskinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had dearly\\r\\nloved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though she had endowed\\r\\nhim with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of his eyesight. Pontonous\\r\\nset a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He\\r\\nhung the lyre for him on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to\\r\\nfeel for it with his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals\\r\\nby his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so\\r\\ndisposed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,\\r\\nbut as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse inspired\\r\\nDemodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a matter that was\\r\\nthen in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel between Ulysses and\\r\\nAchilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat\\r\\ntogether at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains\\r\\nquarrelling with one another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he\\r\\ncrossed the stone floor to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the\\r\\nevil that by the will of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and\\r\\ncovered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he was\\r\\nweeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes,\\r\\nuncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but\\r\\nwhen the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for they delighted in\\r\\nhis lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly.\\r\\nNo one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and\\r\\nheard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said, “Aldermen and\\r\\ntown councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast,\\r\\nand of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore\\r\\nto the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be able to\\r\\ntell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers,\\r\\njumpers, and runners.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A servant hung\\r\\nDemodocus’s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the cloister, and set him\\r\\non the same way as that along which all the chief men of the Phaeacians were\\r\\ngoing to see the sports; a crowd of several thousands of people followed them,\\r\\nand there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos,\\r\\nOcyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus,\\r\\nThoon, Anabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also\\r\\nEuryalus son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking\\r\\nman among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\\r\\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the starting\\r\\npost, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew forward at the\\r\\nsame moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else\\r\\nbehind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in a\\r\\nfallow field.[67]\\r\\nThey then turned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to\\r\\nbe the best man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at\\r\\nthrowing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous’s son\\r\\nLaodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had\\r\\nall been diverted with the games, “Let us ask the stranger whether he excels in\\r\\nany of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs, calves, hands,\\r\\nand neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered\\r\\nmuch lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no\\r\\nmatter how strong he is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are quite right, Laodamas,” replied Euryalus, “go up to your guest and\\r\\nspeak to him about it yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said\\r\\nto Ulysses, “I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some one or other of\\r\\nour competitions if you are skilled in any of them—and you must have gone in\\r\\nfor many a one before now. There is nothing that does any one so much credit\\r\\nall his life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet.\\r\\nHave a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your\\r\\nreturn home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the\\r\\nwater, and the crew is found.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is set\\r\\nrather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite trouble, and am\\r\\ncome among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people to further me\\r\\non my return home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, “I gather, then, that you are\\r\\nunskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in. I suppose\\r\\nyou are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or\\r\\nmerchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward\\r\\ncargoes. There does not seem to be much of the athlete about you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For shame, Sir,” answered Ulysses, fiercely, “you are an insolent fellow—so\\r\\ntrue is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in speech, person, and\\r\\nunderstanding. One man may be of weak presence, but heaven has adorned this\\r\\nwith such a good conversation that he charms every one who sees him; his\\r\\nhoneyed moderation carries his hearers with him so that he is leader in all\\r\\nassemblies of his fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may\\r\\nbe as handsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.\\r\\nThis is your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but\\r\\nyou are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you\\r\\nare quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so\\r\\nlong as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the age.\\r\\nNow, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much\\r\\nboth on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite\\r\\nof all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger,\\r\\nmore massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians when\\r\\ndisc-throwing among themselves.[68] Then, swinging it back, he threw it\\r\\nfrom his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did so. The\\r\\nPhaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped gracefully from\\r\\nhis hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been made yet. Minerva, in the form\\r\\nof a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen. “A blind man, Sir,”\\r\\nsaid she, “could easily tell your mark by groping for it—it is so far ahead of\\r\\nany other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can\\r\\ncome near to such a throw as yours.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so he\\r\\nbegan to speak more pleasantly. “Young men,” said he, “come up to that throw if\\r\\nyou can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier. If anyone\\r\\nwants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly angry; I\\r\\nwill box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with any man of you all\\r\\nexcept Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot\\r\\ncompete with one’s own personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or\\r\\na sensible thing for a guest to challenge his host’s family at any game,\\r\\nespecially when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under\\r\\nhis own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I\\r\\nwant to have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at\\r\\nevery kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent archer. In\\r\\nbattle I am always the first to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how\\r\\nmany more are taking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man\\r\\nwho could shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in\\r\\npractice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those who still eat\\r\\nbread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the\\r\\nmighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian—men who could shoot\\r\\nagainst the gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by\\r\\nhis end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him\\r\\nas an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow.\\r\\nRunning is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the\\r\\nPhaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my\\r\\nprovisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, “Sir, we have had\\r\\nmuch pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I understand\\r\\nthat you are willing to show your prowess, as having been displeased with some\\r\\ninsolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes, and which\\r\\ncould never have been uttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety.\\r\\nI hope you will apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any one of your chief\\r\\nmen who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we\\r\\nhave an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not\\r\\nparticularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are\\r\\nsingularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of\\r\\ngood dinners, music, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen, warm\\r\\nbaths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best dancers set\\r\\nabout dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his\\r\\nfriends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, and\\r\\nminstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of\\r\\nyou and fetch it for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king’s house, and the\\r\\nnine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was their business\\r\\nto manage everything connected with the sports, so they made the ground smooth\\r\\nand marked a wide space for the dancers. Presently the servant came back with\\r\\nDemodocus’s lyre, and he took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best\\r\\nyoung dancers in the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was\\r\\ndelighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how they\\r\\nfirst began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus many\\r\\npresents, and defiled King Vulcan’s marriage bed, so the sun, who saw what they\\r\\nwere about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he heard such dreadful\\r\\nnews, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its\\r\\nplace, and began to forge some chains which none could either unloose or break,\\r\\nso that they might stay there in that place.[69] When he had finished his snare he\\r\\nwent into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like\\r\\ncobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not\\r\\neven a god could see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had\\r\\nspread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for\\r\\nthe fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was the one he was\\r\\nmost fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start,\\r\\nhurried off to his house, burning with love for Venus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was about\\r\\nsitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took her hand in\\r\\nhis own, “Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at home, but is gone off\\r\\nto Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is barbarous.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest, whereon\\r\\nthey were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread for them, and\\r\\ncould neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late that they were\\r\\nin a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had turned back before reaching\\r\\nLemnos, when his scout the sun told him what was going on. He was in a furious\\r\\npassion, and stood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to\\r\\nall the gods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” he cried, “and all you other blessed gods who live for ever,\\r\\ncome here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will show you.\\r\\nJove’s daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because I am lame. She is in\\r\\nlove with Mars, who is handsome and clean built, whereas I am a cripple—but my\\r\\nparents are to blame for that, not I; they ought never to have begotten me.\\r\\nCome and see the pair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at\\r\\nthem. They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there\\r\\nlonger than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,\\r\\nhowever, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for\\r\\nhis baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling Neptune\\r\\ncame, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the goddesses staid\\r\\nat home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all good things stood in the\\r\\ndoorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they\\r\\nsaw how cunning Vulcan had been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour\\r\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how limping\\r\\nVulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god in heaven; and\\r\\nnow Mars will be cast in heavy damages.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, “Messenger Mercury,\\r\\ngiver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains were, would you,\\r\\nif you could sleep with Venus?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“King Apollo,” answered Mercury, “I only wish I might get the chance, though\\r\\nthere were three times as many chains—and you might look on, all of you, gods\\r\\nand goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took it all\\r\\nseriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again. “Let him go,”\\r\\nhe cried, “and I will undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you all the\\r\\ndamages that are held reasonable among the immortal gods.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not,” replied Vulcan, “ask me to do this; a bad man’s bond is bad security;\\r\\nwhat remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go away and leave his\\r\\ndebts behind him along with his chains?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Vulcan,” said Neptune, “if Mars goes away without paying his damages, I will\\r\\npay you myself.” So Vulcan answered, “In this case I cannot and must not refuse\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were free they\\r\\nscampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to Cyprus and to\\r\\nPaphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with burnt offerings. Here\\r\\nthe Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the\\r\\nimmortal gods make use of, and they clothed her in raiment of the most\\r\\nenchanting beauty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were charmed\\r\\nas they heard him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no one to\\r\\ncompete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had made for them, and\\r\\none of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards the clouds, while\\r\\nthe other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it came\\r\\ndown again. When they had done throwing the ball straight up into the air they\\r\\nbegan to dance, and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards\\r\\nto one another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great\\r\\nstamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the world,\\r\\nand indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished as I saw\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians, “Aldermen and\\r\\ntown councillors, our guest seems to be a person of singular judgement; let us\\r\\ngive him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably expect. There are\\r\\ntwelve chief men among you, and counting myself there are thirteen; contribute,\\r\\neach of you, a clean cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him\\r\\nall this in a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so\\r\\nwith a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\\r\\npresent too, for he has been rude.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and sent their\\r\\nservants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, “King Alcinous, I will give\\r\\nthe stranger all the satisfaction you require. He shall have my sword, which is\\r\\nof bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. I will also give him the\\r\\nscabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits. It will be worth a great deal\\r\\nto him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, “Good luck to\\r\\nyou, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the winds blow it\\r\\naway with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, for I understand you\\r\\nhave been long away from home, and have gone through much hardship.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo which Ulysses answered, “Good luck to you too my friend, and may the gods\\r\\ngrant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you have given me\\r\\nalong with your apology.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards sundown\\r\\nthe presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of the donors kept\\r\\nbringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his sons received them, and\\r\\nplaced them under their mother’s charge. Then Alcinous led the way to the house\\r\\nand bade his guests take their seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Wife,” said he, turning to Queen Arete, “Go, fetch the best chest we have, and\\r\\nput a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the fire and heat some\\r\\nwater; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing of the\\r\\npresents that the noble Phaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy\\r\\nboth his supper and the singing that will follow. I shall myself give him this\\r\\ngolden goblet—which is of exquisite workmanship—that he may be reminded of me\\r\\nfor the rest of his life whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove, or to any\\r\\nof the gods.”[70]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as they\\r\\ncould, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire; they\\r\\nthrew on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played\\r\\nabout the belly of the tripod.[71] Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent\\r\\nchest from her own room, and inside it she packed all the beautiful presents of\\r\\ngold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and\\r\\na good shirt from Alcinous, and said to Ulysses:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for fear any\\r\\none should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your ship.” [72]\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast with a\\r\\nbond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper servant told him\\r\\nto come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad of a warm bath, for he\\r\\nhad had no one to wait upon him ever since he left the house of Calypso, who as\\r\\nlong as he remained with her had taken as good care of him as though he had\\r\\nbeen a god. When the servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and\\r\\nhad given him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the\\r\\nguests who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the\\r\\nbearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as she saw\\r\\nhim pass. “Farewell stranger,” said she, “do not forget me when you are safe at\\r\\nhome again, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having saved your\\r\\nlife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses said, “Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the mighty\\r\\nhusband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall I bless you as my\\r\\nguardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was then\\r\\nserved, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the favourite\\r\\nbard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near one of the\\r\\nbearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean against it. Then\\r\\nUlysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of fat (for there was\\r\\nabundance left on the joint) and said to a servant, “Take this piece of pork\\r\\nover to Demodocus and tell him to eat it; for all the pain his lays may cause\\r\\nme I will salute him none the less; bards are honoured and respected throughout\\r\\nthe world, for the muse teaches them their songs and loves them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who took it and\\r\\nwas very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good things that were\\r\\nbefore them, and as soon as they had had to eat and drink, Ulysses said to\\r\\nDemodocus, “Demodocus, there is no one in the world whom I admire more than I\\r\\ndo you. You must have studied under the Muse, Jove’s daughter, and under\\r\\nApollo, so accurately do you sing the return of the Achaeans with all their\\r\\nsufferings and adventures. If you were not there yourself, you must have heard\\r\\nit all from some one who was. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the\\r\\nwooden horse which Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses\\r\\ngot by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who\\r\\nafterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all\\r\\nthe world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some of the\\r\\nArgives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others, hidden within the\\r\\nhorse,[73] were\\r\\nwaiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place of assembly. For the Trojans\\r\\nthemselves had drawn the horse into their fortress, and it stood there while\\r\\nthey sat in council round it, and were in three minds as to what they should\\r\\ndo. Some were for breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged\\r\\nto the top of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the\\r\\nprecipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and\\r\\npropitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the end, for the\\r\\ncity was doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all the bravest\\r\\nof the Argives waiting to bring death and destruction on the Trojans. Anon he\\r\\nsang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town,\\r\\nbreaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city hither and\\r\\nthither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with\\r\\nMenelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most\\r\\nfuriously, nevertheless by Minerva’s help he was victorious.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his cheeks were\\r\\nwet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws herself on the body of\\r\\nher husband who has fallen before his own city and people, fighting bravely in\\r\\ndefence of his home and children. She screams aloud and flings her arms about\\r\\nhim as he lies gasping for breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from\\r\\nbehind about the back and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life\\r\\nof labour and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks—even so piteously\\r\\ndid Ulysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except\\r\\nAlcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs that he\\r\\nwas heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease his song,\\r\\nfor there are those present who do not seem to like it. From the moment that we\\r\\nhad done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our guest has been all the time\\r\\ngroaning and lamenting. He is evidently in great trouble, so let the bard leave\\r\\noff, that we may all enjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much\\r\\nmore as it should be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the\\r\\npresents that we are making with so much good will are wholly in his honour,\\r\\nand any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to\\r\\ntreat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor reserve in\\r\\nthe matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more polite in you to give\\r\\nme a plain answer; tell me the name by which your father and mother over yonder\\r\\nused to call you, and by which you were known among your neighbours and\\r\\nfellow-citizens. There is no one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely\\r\\nwithout any name whatever, for people’s fathers and mothers give them names as\\r\\nsoon as they are born. Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that our\\r\\nships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there. For the\\r\\nPhaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other\\r\\nnations have, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are\\r\\nthinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the whole\\r\\nworld, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is covered with mist\\r\\nand cloud, so that there is no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm.\\r\\nStill I do remember hearing my father say that Neptune was angry with us for\\r\\nbeing too easy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He said that one\\r\\nof these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having\\r\\nescorted some one,[74] and bury our city under a high\\r\\nmountain. This is what my father used to say, but whether the god will carry\\r\\nout his threat or no is a matter which he will decide for himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and in what\\r\\ncountries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples themselves, and of their\\r\\ncities—who were hostile, savage and uncivilised, and who, on the other hand,\\r\\nhospitable and humane. Tell us also why you are made so unhappy on hearing\\r\\nabout the return of the Argive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this,\\r\\nand sent them their misfortunes in order that future generations might have\\r\\nsomething to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife’s when\\r\\nyou were before Troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law—which are the nearest\\r\\nrelations a man has outside his own flesh and blood? or was it some brave and\\r\\nkindly-natured comrade—for a good friend is as dear to a man as his own\\r\\nbrother?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK IX\\n\\r\\nULYSSES DECLARES HIMSELF AND BEGINS HIS STORY—-THE CICONS, LOTOPHAGI, AND\\r\\nCYCLOPES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard with\\r\\nsuch a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or more delightful\\r\\nthan when a whole people make merry together, with the guests sitting orderly\\r\\nto listen, while the table is loaded with bread and meats, and the cup-bearer\\r\\ndraws wine and fills his cup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a\\r\\nman can see. Now, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my\\r\\nsorrows, and rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how\\r\\nto begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven\\r\\nhas been laid heavily upon me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and one day,\\r\\nif I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though I live so far\\r\\naway from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes, renowned among mankind for\\r\\nall manner of subtlety, so that my fame ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca,\\r\\nwhere there is a high mountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not\\r\\nfar from it there is a group of islands very near to one another—Dulichium,\\r\\nSame, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all\\r\\nhighest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it\\r\\ntowards dawn.[75]\\r\\nIt is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my eyes know none that they\\r\\nbetter love to look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and\\r\\nwanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they\\r\\ncould neither of them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man than\\r\\nhis own country and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a\\r\\nforeign country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it.\\r\\nNow, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove’s\\r\\nwill I met with on my return from Troy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is the\\r\\ncity of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to the sword. We\\r\\ntook their wives and also much booty, which we divided equitably amongst us, so\\r\\nthat none might have reason to complain. I then said that we had better make\\r\\noff at once, but my men very foolishly would not obey me, so they staid there\\r\\ndrinking much wine and killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea\\r\\nshore. Meanwhile the Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons who lived\\r\\ninland. These were more in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in\\r\\nthe art of war, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the\\r\\noccasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as leaves and\\r\\nbloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us, so that we were hard\\r\\npressed. They set the battle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed their\\r\\nbronze-shod spears at one another.[76] So long as the day waxed and it was\\r\\nstill morning, we held our own against them, though they were more in number\\r\\nthan we; but as the sun went down, towards the time when men loose their oxen,\\r\\nthe Cicons got the better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship\\r\\nwe had; so we got away with those that were left.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped\\r\\ndeath though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we had thrice\\r\\ninvoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the hands of the\\r\\nCicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it blew a hurricane, so\\r\\nthat land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of\\r\\nthe heavens. We let the ships run before the gale, but the force of the wind\\r\\ntore our sails to tatters, so we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and\\r\\nrowed our hardest towards the land. There we lay two days and two nights\\r\\nsuffering much alike from toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the\\r\\nthird day we again raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the\\r\\nwind and steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at that time\\r\\nunharmed had not the North wind and the currents been against me as I was\\r\\ndoubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by the island of Cythera.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the sea, but\\r\\non the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who live on a food\\r\\nthat comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take in fresh water, and\\r\\nour crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near the ships. When they had\\r\\neaten and drunk I sent two of my company to see what manner of men the people\\r\\nof the place might be, and they had a third man under them. They started at\\r\\nonce, and went about among the Lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave\\r\\nthem to eat of the lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate of it left\\r\\noff caring about home, and did not even want to go back and say what had\\r\\nhappened to them, but were for staying and munching lotus[77] with the Lotus-eaters without\\r\\nthinking further of their return; nevertheless, though they wept bitterly I\\r\\nforced them back to the ships and made them fast under the benches. Then I told\\r\\nthe rest to go on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and\\r\\nleave off wanting to get home, so they took their places and smote the grey sea\\r\\nwith their oars.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land of the\\r\\nlawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor plough, but\\r\\ntrust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and grapes as grow wild\\r\\nwithout any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes yield them wine as the sun\\r\\nand the rain may grow them. They have no laws nor assemblies of the people, but\\r\\nlive in caves on the tops of high mountains; each is lord and master in his\\r\\nfamily, and they take no account of their neighbours.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite close\\r\\nto the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is over-run with wild goats,\\r\\nthat breed there in great numbers and are never disturbed by foot of man; for\\r\\nsportsmen—who as a rule will suffer so much hardship in forest or among\\r\\nmountain precipices—do not go there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed\\r\\ndown, but it lies a wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has\\r\\nno living thing upon it but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet\\r\\nshipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city\\r\\nto city, or sail over the sea to one another’s country as people who have ships\\r\\ncan do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island,[78] for it is a very\\r\\ngood one, and would yield everything in due season. There are meadows that in\\r\\nsome places come right down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious\\r\\ngrass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land for ploughing,\\r\\nand it would always yield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. There\\r\\nis a good harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship\\r\\nbe moored, but all one has to do is to beach one’s vessel and stay there till\\r\\nthe wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of the harbour\\r\\nthere is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars\\r\\ngrowing all round it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have brought us\\r\\nin, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist hung all round our\\r\\nships;[79] the moon\\r\\nwas hidden behind a mass of clouds so that no one could have seen the island if\\r\\nhe had looked for it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in\\r\\nshore before we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had\\r\\nbeached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the\\r\\nbeach till daybreak.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we admired the island\\r\\nand wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove’s daughters roused the wild\\r\\ngoats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On this we fetched our spears\\r\\nand bows and arrows from the ships, and dividing ourselves into three bands\\r\\nbegan to shoot the goats. Heaven sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships\\r\\nwith me, and each ship got nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through\\r\\nthe livelong day to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, and we\\r\\nhad plenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we\\r\\nsacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we were\\r\\nfeasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the Cyclopes, which was\\r\\nhard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires. We could almost fancy we\\r\\nheard their voices and the bleating of their sheep and goats, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and it came on dark, we camped down upon the beach, and next morning\\r\\nI called a council.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stay here, my brave fellows,’ said I, ‘all the rest of you, while I go with\\r\\nmy ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if they are uncivilised\\r\\nsavages, or a hospitable and humane race.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers; so they\\r\\ntook their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When we got to the\\r\\nland, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff near the sea, we saw a\\r\\ngreat cave overhung with laurels. It was a station for a great many sheep and\\r\\ngoats, and outside there was a large yard, with a high wall round it made of\\r\\nstones built into the ground and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode\\r\\nof a huge monster who was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He would\\r\\nhave nothing to do with other people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was a\\r\\nhorrid creature, not like a human being at all, but resembling rather some crag\\r\\nthat stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high mountain.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all but the\\r\\ntwelve best among them, who were to go along with myself. I also took a\\r\\ngoatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by Maron, son of Euanthes,\\r\\nwho was priest of Apollo the patron god of Ismarus, and lived within the wooded\\r\\nprecincts of the temple. When we were sacking the city we respected him, and\\r\\nspared his life, as also his wife and child; so he made me some presents of\\r\\ngreat value—seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars\\r\\nof sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid\\r\\nin the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and one housekeeper:\\r\\nwhen he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the\\r\\nfragrance from the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to\\r\\nrefrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet\\r\\nfull of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to deal\\r\\nwith some savage who would be of great strength, and would respect neither\\r\\nright nor law.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside and\\r\\ntook stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded with cheeses,\\r\\nand he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold. They were kept in\\r\\nseparate flocks; first there were the hoggets, then the oldest of the younger\\r\\nlambs and lastly the very young ones[80] all kept apart from one another; as\\r\\nfor his dairy, all the vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked,\\r\\nwere swimming with whey. When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them\\r\\nfirst steal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they would then\\r\\nreturn, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with\\r\\nthem. It would have been indeed better if we had done so but I would not listen\\r\\nto them, for I wanted to see the owner himself, in the hope that he might give\\r\\nme a present. When, however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal with.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of them,\\r\\nand then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his sheep. When he\\r\\ncame, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood to light the fire for\\r\\nhis supper, and this he flung with such a noise on to the floor of his cave\\r\\nthat we hid ourselves for fear at the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove\\r\\nall the ewes inside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk,\\r\\nleaving the males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled\\r\\na huge stone to the mouth of the cave—so huge that two and twenty strong\\r\\nfour-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it from its place against the\\r\\ndoorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in\\r\\ndue course, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half the\\r\\nmilk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into\\r\\nbowls that he might drink it for his supper. When he had got through with all\\r\\nhis work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do you sail\\r\\nthe sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every man’s hand\\r\\nagainst you?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous form, but\\r\\nI managed to say, ‘We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy, but by the will\\r\\nof Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far out of our course. We\\r\\nare the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who has won infinite renown\\r\\nthroughout the whole world, by sacking so great a city and killing so many\\r\\npeople. We therefore humbly pray you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise\\r\\nmake us such presents as visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellency\\r\\nfear the wrath of heaven, for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes all\\r\\nrespectable travellers under his protection, for he is the avenger of all\\r\\nsuppliants and foreigners in distress.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, ‘Stranger,’ said he, ‘you are a\\r\\nfool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me, indeed, about\\r\\nfearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do not care about Jove or\\r\\nany of your blessed gods, for we are ever so much stronger than they. I shall\\r\\nnot spare either yourself or your companions out of any regard for Jove, unless\\r\\nI am in the humour for doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast\\r\\nwhen you came on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off\\r\\nthe land?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in that way,\\r\\nso I answered with a lie; ‘Neptune,’ said I, ‘sent my ship on to the rocks at\\r\\nthe far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were driven on to them from the\\r\\nopen sea, but I and those who are with me escaped the jaws of death.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a sudden\\r\\nclutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down upon the ground\\r\\nas though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed upon the ground, and\\r\\nthe earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore them limb from limb and supped\\r\\nupon them. He gobbled them up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones,\\r\\nmarrow, and entrails, without leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and\\r\\nlifted up our hands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not\\r\\nknow what else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had\\r\\nwashed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched\\r\\nhimself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I was\\r\\nat first inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals, but\\r\\nI reflected that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we should never\\r\\nbe able to shift the stone which the monster had put in front of the door. So\\r\\nwe stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till morning came.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit his\\r\\nfire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let each have her\\r\\nown young one; as soon as he had got through with all his work, he clutched up\\r\\ntwo more of my men, and began eating them for his morning’s meal. Presently,\\r\\nwith the utmost ease, he rolled the stone away from the door and drove out his\\r\\nsheep, but he at once put it back again—as easily as though he were merely\\r\\nclapping the lid on to a quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he\\r\\nshouted, and cried ‘Shoo, shoo,’ after his sheep to drive them on to the\\r\\nmountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering\\r\\nmyself with glory.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: The Cyclops\\r\\nhad a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it was of green\\r\\nolive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for a staff as soon as it\\r\\nshould be dry. It was so huge that we could only compare it to the mast of a\\r\\ntwenty-oared merchant vessel of large burden, and able to venture out into open\\r\\nsea. I went up to this club and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this\\r\\npiece to the men and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they\\r\\nproceeded to do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in\\r\\nthe fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was\\r\\nlying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of them\\r\\nshould venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the monster’s eye\\r\\nwhile he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen,\\r\\nand I myself made five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding,\\r\\nand drove his flocks into the cave—this time driving them all inside, and not\\r\\nleaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god\\r\\nmust have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its\\r\\nplace against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite\\r\\nrightly, and then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with\\r\\nall this work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them.\\r\\nSo I went up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Look here, Cyclops,’ said I, you have been eating a great deal of man’s\\r\\nflesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what kind of liquor\\r\\nwe had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a drink-offering, in the\\r\\nhope that you would take compassion upon me and further me on my way home,\\r\\nwhereas all you do is to go on ramping and raving most intolerably. You ought\\r\\nto be ashamed of yourself; how can you expect people to come see you any more\\r\\nif you treat them in this way?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of the wine\\r\\nthat he begged me for another bowl full. ‘Be so kind,’ he said, ‘as to give me\\r\\nsome more, and tell me your name at once. I want to make you a present that you\\r\\nwill be glad to have. We have wine even in this country, for our soil grows\\r\\ngrapes and the sun ripens them, but this drinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in\\r\\none.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him, and three\\r\\ntimes did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I saw that the wine\\r\\nhad got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as I could: ‘Cyclops, you ask\\r\\nmy name and I will tell it you; give me, therefore, the present you promised\\r\\nme; my name is Noman; this is what my father and mother and my friends have\\r\\nalways called me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the cruel wretch said, ‘Then I will eat all Noman’s comrades before Noman\\r\\nhimself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the present that I will make\\r\\nhim.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground. His\\r\\ngreat neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him.\\r\\nPresently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh\\r\\non which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I thrust the beam of\\r\\nwood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them\\r\\nshould turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to\\r\\nblaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round\\r\\nme, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of\\r\\nthe beam into the monster’s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept\\r\\nturning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship’s plank\\r\\nwith an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long\\r\\nas they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the\\r\\nboiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the\\r\\nsteam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots\\r\\nof the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet\\r\\ninto cold water to temper it—for it is this that gives strength to the iron—and\\r\\nit makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops’ eye hiss round\\r\\nthe beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran\\r\\naway in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his\\r\\neye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so\\r\\nto the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they\\r\\ngathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked\\r\\nwhat was the matter with him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that you make such a noise, breaking\\r\\nthe stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able to sleep? Surely\\r\\nno man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is trying to kill you either\\r\\nby fraud or by force?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, ‘Noman is killing me by\\r\\nfraud; no man is killing me by force.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then,’ said they, ‘if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Jove\\r\\nmakes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray to your\\r\\nfather Neptune.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever\\r\\nstratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about with\\r\\nhis hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the\\r\\ndoorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with\\r\\nthe sheep, for he thought I might be foolish enough to attempt this.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own life\\r\\nand those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows that his\\r\\nlife depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the end I deemed that\\r\\nthis plan would be the best; the male sheep were well grown, and carried a\\r\\nheavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some\\r\\nof the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man\\r\\nunder the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that\\r\\nthere were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than\\r\\nany of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the\\r\\nthick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards,\\r\\nkeeping a firm hold on it all the time.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but when the\\r\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep hurried out to\\r\\nfeed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be milked, for\\r\\ntheir udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of all his pain\\r\\nfelt the backs of all the sheep as they stood upright, without being sharp\\r\\nenough to find out that the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was\\r\\ngoing out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty\\r\\nself, Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this\\r\\nmorning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the mob with\\r\\na run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the first to come\\r\\nhome again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it because you know your\\r\\nmaster has lost his eye, and are sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid\\r\\ncrew has got him down in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life\\r\\nyet. If you could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is\\r\\nhiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the\\r\\ncave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has\\r\\ndone me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way out from\\r\\nthe cave and yards, I first got from under the ram’s belly, and then freed my\\r\\ncomrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly heading them in\\r\\nthe right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship. The crew\\r\\nrejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death, but wept for the\\r\\nothers whom the Cyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding\\r\\nand frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the\\r\\nsheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their\\r\\nplaces, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out\\r\\nas my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Cyclops,’ said I, ‘you should have taken better measure of your man before\\r\\neating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your visitors in your\\r\\nown house? You might have known that your sin would find you out, and now Jove\\r\\nand the other gods have punished you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from off a\\r\\nhigh mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that it was within a\\r\\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder.[81] The sea quaked as the rock fell into\\r\\nit, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland,\\r\\nand forced us towards the shore. But I snatched up a long pole and kept the\\r\\nship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for\\r\\ntheir lives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as\\r\\nwe were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and\\r\\nprayed of me to hold my tongue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do not,’ they exclaimed, ‘be mad enough to provoke this savage creature\\r\\nfurther; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back again to the\\r\\nmainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us; if he had then heard\\r\\nany further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ship’s\\r\\ntimbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he\\r\\ncan throw them a long way.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage, ‘Cyclops,\\r\\nif any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty,\\r\\nsay it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this he groaned, and cried out, ‘Alas, alas, then the old prophecy about me\\r\\nis coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man both brave and of\\r\\ngreat stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an excellent seer, and did all\\r\\nthe prophesying for the Cyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this\\r\\nwould happen to me some day, and said I should lose my sight by the hand of\\r\\nUlysses. I have been all along expecting some one of imposing presence and\\r\\nsuperhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant\\r\\nweakling, who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my\\r\\ndrink; come here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to show my\\r\\nhospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward on your journey—for Neptune\\r\\nand I are father and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me, which no one else\\r\\nneither god nor man can do.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I said, ‘I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and sending\\r\\nyou down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more than Neptune to\\r\\ncure that eye of yours.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed, saying,\\r\\n‘Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten son, grant that\\r\\nUlysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must get back to his friends\\r\\nat last, let him do so late and in sore plight after losing all his men [let\\r\\nhim reach his home in another man’s ship and find trouble in his house.’[82]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a rock much\\r\\nlarger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with prodigious force. It\\r\\nfell just short of the ship, but was within a little of hitting the end of the\\r\\nrudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it\\r\\nraised drove us onwards on our way towards the shore of the island.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our ships, we\\r\\nfound our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our return. We ran our\\r\\nvessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the sea shore; we also landed\\r\\nthe Cyclops’ sheep, and divided them equitably amongst us so that none might\\r\\nhave reason to complain. As for the ram, my companions agreed that I should\\r\\nhave it as an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its\\r\\nthigh bones to Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice,\\r\\nand only thought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill\\r\\non meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped\\r\\nupon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I bade\\r\\nmy men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they took their places and smote\\r\\nthe grey sea with their oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, but\\r\\nglad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK X\\n\\r\\nAEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of Hippotas,\\r\\ndear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it were) upon the\\r\\nsea,[83] iron bound\\r\\nwith a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so\\r\\nhe made the sons marry the daughters, and they all live with their dear father\\r\\nand mother, feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day\\r\\nlong the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats\\r\\ntill it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well made\\r\\nbedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These were the people\\r\\namong whom we had now come.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the time about\\r\\nTroy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I told him exactly how\\r\\neverything had happened, and when I said I must go, and asked him to further me\\r\\non my way, he made no sort of difficulty, but set about doing so at once.\\r\\nMoreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds,\\r\\nwhich he shut up in the hide as in a sack—for Jove had made him captain over\\r\\nthe winds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own\\r\\npleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a\\r\\nsilver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow from any\\r\\nquarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose;\\r\\nbut it all came to nothing, for we were lost through our own folly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native land\\r\\nshowed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the stubble fires\\r\\nburning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light sleep, for I had never\\r\\nlet the rudder out of my own hands, that we might get home the faster. On this\\r\\nthe men fell to talking among themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and\\r\\nsilver in the sack that Aeolus had given me. ‘Bless my heart,’ would one turn\\r\\nto his neighbour, saying, ‘how this man gets honoured and makes friends to\\r\\nwhatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from\\r\\nTroy, while we, who have travelled just as far as he has, come back with hands\\r\\nas empty as we set out with—and now Aeolus has given him ever so much more.\\r\\nQuick—let us see what it all is, and how much gold and silver there is in the\\r\\nsack he gave him.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack, whereupon\\r\\nthe wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried us weeping out to\\r\\nsea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and knew not whether to throw\\r\\nmyself into the sea or to live on and make the best of it; but I bore it,\\r\\ncovered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as\\r\\nthe fierce winds bore our fleet back to the Aeolian island.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by the\\r\\nships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men and went\\r\\nstraight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting with his wife and\\r\\nfamily; so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold. They were astounded when\\r\\nthey saw us and said, ‘Ulysses, what brings you here? What god has been\\r\\nill-treating you? We took great pains to further you on your way home to\\r\\nIthaca, or wherever it was that you wanted to go to.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, ‘My men have undone me; they,\\r\\nand cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this mischief, for you can\\r\\nif you will.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their father\\r\\nanswered, ‘Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the island; him whom\\r\\nheaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you come here as one abhorred\\r\\nof heaven.’ And with these words he sent me sorrowing from his door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and fruitless\\r\\nrowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six days, night and day\\r\\ndid we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the rocky stronghold of\\r\\nLamus—Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians, where the shepherd who is\\r\\ndriving in his sheep and goats [to be milked] salutes him who is driving out\\r\\nhis flock [to feed] and this last answers the salute. In that country a man who\\r\\ncould do without sleep might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle,\\r\\nand another as a shepherd, for they work much the same by night as they do by\\r\\nday.[84]\\n\\n\\r\\n“When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs, with a\\r\\nnarrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took all their ships inside,\\r\\nand made them fast close to one another, for there was never so much as a\\r\\nbreath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. I kept my own ship outside,\\r\\nand moored it to a rock at the very end of the point; then I climbed a high\\r\\nrock to reconnoitre, but could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some\\r\\nsmoke rising from the ground. So I sent two of my company with an attendant to\\r\\nfind out what sort of people the inhabitants were.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the people draw\\r\\ntheir firewood from the mountains into the town, till presently they met a\\r\\nyoung woman who had come outside to fetch water, and who was daughter to a\\r\\nLaestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going to the fountain Artacia from\\r\\nwhich the people bring in their water, and when my men had come close up to\\r\\nher, they asked her who the king of that country might be, and over what kind\\r\\nof people he ruled; so she directed them to her father’s house, but when they\\r\\ngot there they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they\\r\\nwere horrified at the sight of her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly, and\\r\\nforthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them, and began to\\r\\nmake his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other two ran back to the\\r\\nships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates raised a hue-and-cry after\\r\\nthem, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians sprang up from every\\r\\nquarter—ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though\\r\\nthey had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching\\r\\nup against one another, and the death cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians\\r\\nspeared them like fishes and took them home to eat them. While they were thus\\r\\nkilling my men within the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own\\r\\nship, and told my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare\\r\\nlike the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough\\r\\nwhen we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. As for\\r\\nthe others there was not one of them left.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our\\r\\ncomrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe lives—a great and cunning\\r\\ngoddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes—for they are both children of\\r\\nthe sun by Perse, who is daughter to Oceanus. We brought our ship into a safe\\r\\nharbour without a word, for some god guided us thither, and having landed we\\r\\nlay there for two days and two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the\\r\\nmorning of the third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from\\r\\nthe ship to reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork,\\r\\nor hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I espied\\r\\nthe smoke of Circe’s house rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees, and\\r\\nwhen I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I would not go on at\\r\\nonce and find out more, but in the end I deemed it best to go back to the ship,\\r\\ngive the men their dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my solitude,\\r\\nand sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my path. He was coming\\r\\ndown his pasture in the forest to drink of the river, for the heat of the sun\\r\\ndrove him, and as he passed I struck him in the middle of the back; the bronze\\r\\npoint of the spear went clean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust\\r\\nuntil the life went out of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from\\r\\nthe wound, and laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted\\r\\nthem into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet\\r\\nof the noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my neck and\\r\\nwalked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too big\\r\\nfor me to be able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As\\r\\nI threw him down in front of the ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly\\r\\nman by man to each of them. ‘Look here my friends,’ said I, ‘we are not going\\r\\nto die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so\\r\\nlong as we have got something to eat and drink on board.’ On this they\\r\\nuncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was\\r\\nindeed a splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their eyes upon him\\r\\nsufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed there\\r\\neating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it came on dark,\\r\\nwe camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,\\r\\nappeared, I called a council and said, ‘My friends, we are in very great\\r\\ndifficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no idea where the sun either sets\\r\\nor rises,[85] so\\r\\nthat we do not even know East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless,\\r\\nwe must try and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as\\r\\nI could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon; it\\r\\nlies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick forest\\r\\nof trees.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had been\\r\\ntreated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre Polyphemus.\\r\\nThey wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to be got by crying,\\r\\nso I divided them into two companies and set a captain over each; I gave one\\r\\ncompany to Eurylochus, while I took command of the other myself. Then we cast\\r\\nlots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his\\r\\ntwenty-two men, and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When they reached Circe’s house they found it built of cut stones, on a site\\r\\nthat could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There were wild\\r\\nmountain wolves and lions prowling all round it—poor bewitched creatures whom\\r\\nshe had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection. They did not\\r\\nattack my men, but wagged their great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their\\r\\nnoses lovingly against them.[86] As hounds crowd round their master\\r\\nwhen they see him coming from dinner—for they know he will bring them\\r\\nsomething—even so did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon\\r\\nmy men, but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.\\r\\nPresently they reached the gates of the goddess’s house, and as they stood\\r\\nthere they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked at\\r\\nher loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours as no one\\r\\nbut a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and trusted more than\\r\\nany other of my men, said, ‘There is some one inside working at a loom and\\r\\nsinging most beautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and\\r\\nsee whether she is woman or goddess.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them enter.\\r\\nThey, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who suspected\\r\\nmischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her house, she set them\\r\\nupon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and\\r\\nPramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked poisons to make them forget their\\r\\nhomes, and when they had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her\\r\\nwand, and shut them up in her pig-styes. They were like pigs—head, hair, and\\r\\nall, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as\\r\\nbefore, and they remembered everything.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns and\\r\\nbeech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to tell me about the\\r\\nsad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay that though he tried\\r\\nto speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes filled with tears and he\\r\\ncould only sob and sigh, till at last we forced his story out of him, and he\\r\\ntold us what had happened to the others.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through the forest, and in the middle of\\r\\nit there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be seen\\r\\nfrom far. There we found a woman, or else she was a goddess, working at her\\r\\nloom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to her and called her, whereon she\\r\\nat once came down, opened the door, and invited us in. The others did not\\r\\nsuspect any mischief so they followed her into the house, but I staid where I\\r\\nwas, for I thought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them\\r\\nno more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching\\r\\nfor them.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also took my\\r\\nbow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the way. But he laid\\r\\nhold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Sir, do not force\\r\\nme to go with you, but let me stay here, for I know you will not bring one of\\r\\nthem back with you, nor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we\\r\\ncannot escape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may still save\\r\\nour lives.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stay where you are, then,’ answered I, ‘eating and drinking at the ship, but\\r\\nI must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the charmed\\r\\ngrove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, I met Mercury\\r\\nwith his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the hey-day of his youth and\\r\\nbeauty with the down just coming upon his face. He came up to me and took my\\r\\nhand within his own, saying, ‘My poor unhappy man, whither are you going over\\r\\nthis mountain top, alone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in\\r\\nCirce’s pigstyes, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not\\r\\nfancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back\\r\\nand will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will\\r\\nprotect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one of\\r\\ngreat virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe’s house, it will be a\\r\\ntalisman to you against every kind of mischief.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try to\\r\\npractice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she will drug the\\r\\nmeal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm you, for the\\r\\nvirtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her spells from working.\\r\\nI will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your\\r\\nsword and spring upon her as though you were going to kill her. She will then\\r\\nbe frightened, and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not\\r\\npoint blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and to\\r\\ntake good care also of yourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all\\r\\nthe blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you, or else\\r\\nwhen she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it was\\r\\nlike. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call\\r\\nit Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do whatever they\\r\\nlike.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island; but I\\r\\nfared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with care as I\\r\\nwalked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called the goddess, and\\r\\nas soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door, and asked me to come\\r\\nin; so I followed her—much troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly\\r\\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a footstool also under my feet,\\r\\nand she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it,\\r\\nfor she meant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without\\r\\nits charming me, she struck me with her wand. ‘There now,’ she cried, ‘be off\\r\\nto the pigstye, and make your lair with the rest of them.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her, whereon\\r\\nshe fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously, saying,\\r\\n‘Who and whence are you? from what place and people have you come? How can it\\r\\nbe that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never yet was any man able to\\r\\nstand so much as a taste of the herb I gave you; you must be spell-proof;\\r\\nsurely you can be none other than the bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always\\r\\nsaid would come here some day with his ship while on his way home from Troy; so\\r\\nbe it then; sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends\\r\\nand learn to trust each other.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I answered, ‘Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with you when you\\r\\nhave just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that you have got me here\\r\\nmyself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to bed with you, and will\\r\\nunman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall certainly not consent to go to\\r\\nbed with you unless you will first take your solemn oath to plot no further\\r\\nharm against me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed her oath\\r\\nthen I went to bed with her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their work.\\r\\nThey are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the holy waters that\\r\\nrun down into the sea. One of them spread a fair purple cloth over a seat, and\\r\\nlaid a carpet underneath it. Another brought tables of silver up to the seats,\\r\\nand set them with baskets of gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in\\r\\na silver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in\\r\\nwater and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had\\r\\nlighted. When the water in the cauldron was boiling,[87] she poured cold into it till it was\\r\\njust as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began washing me from the\\r\\ncauldron about the head and shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of my\\r\\nlimbs. As soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil, she\\r\\narrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richly decorated seat\\r\\ninlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under my feet. A maid servant\\r\\nthen brought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver\\r\\nbasin for me to wash my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper\\r\\nservant brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the\\r\\nhouse, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding\\r\\nwhat was before me, still moody and suspicious.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief, she came\\r\\nto me and said, ‘Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though you were dumb,\\r\\ngnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and drink? Is it that you are\\r\\nstill suspicious? You ought not to be, for I have already sworn solemnly that I\\r\\nwill not hurt you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think of either\\r\\neating or drinking in your house until you have set his friends free and let\\r\\nhim see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you must free my men and bring\\r\\nthem to me that I may see them with my own eyes.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand in her\\r\\nhand and opened the pigstye doors. My men came out like so many prime hogs and\\r\\nstood looking at her, but she went about among them and anointed each with a\\r\\nsecond drug, whereon the bristles that the bad drug had given them fell off,\\r\\nand they became men again, younger than they were before, and much taller and\\r\\nbetter looking. They knew me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and\\r\\nwept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of their\\r\\nhalloa-ballooing, and Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to\\r\\nme and said, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where\\r\\nyou have left your ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all your\\r\\nship’s gear and property in some cave, and come back here with your men.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the men at the\\r\\nship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the silly blubbering\\r\\nfellows began frisking round me as calves break out and gambol round their\\r\\nmothers, when they see them coming home to be milked after they have been\\r\\nfeeding all day, and the homestead resounds with their lowing. They seemed as\\r\\nglad to see me as though they had got back to their own rugged Ithaca, where\\r\\nthey had been born and bred. ‘Sir,’ said the affectionate creatures, ‘we are as\\r\\nglad to see you back as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all\\r\\nabout the fate of our comrades.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I spoke comfortingly to them and said, ‘We must draw our ship on to the land,\\r\\nand hide the ship’s gear with all our property in some cave; then come with me\\r\\nall of you as fast as you can to Circe’s house, where you will find your\\r\\ncomrades eating and drinking in the midst of great abundance.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried to hold\\r\\nthem back and said, ‘Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will become of us?\\r\\nRush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who will turn us all into\\r\\npigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to keep guard over her house.\\r\\nRemember how the Cyclops treated us when our comrades went inside his cave, and\\r\\nUlysses with them. It was all through his sheer folly that those men lost their\\r\\nlives.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen blade that\\r\\nhung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his being a near\\r\\nrelation of my own; but the men interceded for him and said, ‘Sir, if it may so\\r\\nbe, let this fellow stay here and mind the ship, but take the rest of us with\\r\\nyou to Circe’s house.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after all, but\\r\\ncame on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand that I had given\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind were\\r\\nwashed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them woollen cloaks and\\r\\nshirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably at dinner in her house.\\r\\nAs soon as the men saw each other face to face and knew one another, they wept\\r\\nfor joy and cried aloud till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up\\r\\nto me and said, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men to leave off\\r\\ncrying; I know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you\\r\\nhave fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so stay\\r\\nhere, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were\\r\\nwhen you left Ithaca; for at present you are weakened both in body and mind;\\r\\nyou keep all the time thinking of the hardships you have suffered during your\\r\\ntravels, so that you have no more cheerfulness left in you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole\\r\\ntwelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But when\\r\\nthe year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had come round, my\\r\\nmen called me apart and said, ‘Sir, it is time you began to think about going\\r\\nhome, if so be you are to be spared to see your house and native country at\\r\\nall.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to the\\r\\ngoing down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to sleep in the\\r\\ncovered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed with Circe, besought\\r\\nher by her knees, and the goddess listened to what I had got to say. ‘Circe,’\\r\\nsaid I, ‘please to keep the promise you made me about furthering me on my\\r\\nhomeward voyage. I want to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering\\r\\nme with their complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the goddess answered, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall none of\\r\\nyou stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is another journey\\r\\nwhich you have got to take before you can sail homewards. You must go to the\\r\\nhouse of Hades and of dread Proserpine to consult the ghost of the blind Theban\\r\\nprophet Teiresias, whose reason is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine\\r\\nleft his understanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit about\\r\\naimlessly.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would gladly\\r\\nhave lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently when I was\\r\\ntired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, ‘And who shall guide me upon\\r\\nthis voyage—for the house of Hades is a port that no ship can reach.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will want no guide,’ she answered; ‘raise your mast, set your white\\r\\nsails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of itself. When\\r\\nyour ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore\\r\\nof Proserpine’s country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed\\r\\ntheir fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go\\r\\nstraight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where\\r\\nthe rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx)\\r\\nflow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring\\r\\nrivers run into one another.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or\\r\\nso in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink-offering to all\\r\\nthe dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place\\r\\nwater—sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must offer many\\r\\nprayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to\\r\\nIthaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will\\r\\nload the pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that\\r\\nTeiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your\\r\\nflocks.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer them a\\r\\nram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but yourself turn away\\r\\nfrom them as though you would make towards the river. On this, many dead men’s\\r\\nghosts will come to you, and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that\\r\\nyou have just killed, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades\\r\\nand to Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any\\r\\nother poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias shall have\\r\\nanswered your questions. The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you\\r\\nabout your voyage—what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the sea\\r\\nso as to reach your home.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed me in my\\r\\nshirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light gossamer fabric\\r\\nover her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle round her waist, and she\\r\\ncovered her head with a mantle. Then I went about among the men everywhere all\\r\\nover the house, and spoke kindly to each of them man by man: ‘You must not lie\\r\\nsleeping here any longer,’ said I to them, ‘we must be going, for Circe has\\r\\ntold me all about it.’ And on this they did as I bade them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had with us\\r\\na certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or courage, who\\r\\nhad got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the rest of the men, to\\r\\nsleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the noise of the men bustling\\r\\nabout, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main\\r\\nstaircase, so he tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul\\r\\nwent down to the house of Hades.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had got the men together I said to them, ‘You think you are about to\\r\\nstart home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead of this, we have\\r\\ngot to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult the ghost of the\\r\\nTheban prophet Teiresias.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on the\\r\\nground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend matters by\\r\\ncrying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting our fate, Circe\\r\\nbrought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the ship. She passed\\r\\nthrough the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can see the comings and\\r\\ngoings of a god, if the god does not wish to be seen?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XI\\n\\r\\nTHE VISIT TO THE DEAD.[88]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the water\\r\\nand got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on board and took\\r\\nour places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great and\\r\\ncunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and staid steadily with\\r\\nus keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing\\r\\nto the ship’s gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day\\r\\nlong her sails were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of\\r\\nthe river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live\\r\\nenshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce neither\\r\\nat his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but the poor\\r\\nwretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there we beached the\\r\\nship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till\\r\\nwe came to the place of which Circe had told us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug\\r\\nthe trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the dead, first\\r\\nwith honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, and I sprinkled\\r\\nwhite barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless\\r\\nghosts, and promising them that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a\\r\\nbarren heifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with good\\r\\nthings. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep\\r\\nto himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the\\r\\ndead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench,\\r\\nwhereon the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus—brides,[89] young bachelors, old men worn out\\r\\nwith toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been\\r\\nkilled in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they came from\\r\\nevery quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming\\r\\nsound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told the men\\r\\nto be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt\\r\\nofferings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to\\r\\nProserpine; but I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the\\r\\npoor feckless ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my\\r\\nquestions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had not yet\\r\\nbeen laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and unburied in\\r\\nCirce’s house, for we had had too much else to do. I was very sorry for him,\\r\\nand cried when I saw him: ‘Elpenor,’ said I, ‘how did you come down here into\\r\\nthis gloom and darkness? You have got here on foot quicker than I have with my\\r\\nship.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Sir,’ he answered with a groan, ‘it was all bad luck, and my own unspeakable\\r\\ndrunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe’s house, and never thought\\r\\nof coming down again by the great staircase but fell right off the roof and\\r\\nbroke my neck, so my soul came down to the house of Hades. And now I beseech\\r\\nyou by all those whom you have left behind you, though they are not here, by\\r\\nyour wife, by the father who brought you up when you were a child, and by\\r\\nTelemachus who is the one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I\\r\\nknow that when you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the\\r\\nAeaean island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or\\r\\nI may bring heaven’s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I have,\\r\\nbuild a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come\\r\\nwhat a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used to row\\r\\nwith when I was yet alive and with my messmates.’ And I said, ‘My poor fellow,\\r\\nI will do all that you have asked of me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one side\\r\\nof the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost of my comrade\\r\\nsaying all this to me from the other side. Then came the ghost of my dead\\r\\nmother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her alive when I set out for\\r\\nTroy and was moved to tears when I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I\\r\\nwould not let her come near the blood till I had asked my questions of\\r\\nTeiresias.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre in his\\r\\nhand. He knew me and said, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have\\r\\nyou left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place?\\r\\nStand back from the trench and withdraw your sword that I may drink of the\\r\\nblood and answer your questions truly.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of the blood\\r\\nhe began with his prophecy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You want to know,’ said he, ‘about your return home, but heaven will make\\r\\nthis hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye of Neptune, who\\r\\nstill nurses his bitter grudge against you for having blinded his son. Still,\\r\\nafter much suffering you may get home if you can restrain yourself and your\\r\\ncompanions when your ship reaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find\\r\\nthe sheep and cattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to\\r\\neverything. If you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of\\r\\ngetting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm\\r\\nthem, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men.\\r\\nEven though you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing\\r\\nall your men, [in another man’s ship, and you will find trouble in your house,\\r\\nwhich will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devouring your substance\\r\\nunder the pretext of paying court and making presents to your wife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and after you\\r\\nhave killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you must take a well made\\r\\noar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country where the people have\\r\\nnever heard of the sea and do not even mix salt with their food, nor do they\\r\\nknow anything about ships, and oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will\\r\\ngive you this certain token which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will\\r\\nmeet you and will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your\\r\\nshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a\\r\\nbull, and a boar to Neptune.[90] Then go home and offer hecatombs to\\r\\nall the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come\\r\\nto you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very gently when you are full\\r\\nof years and peace of mind, and your people shall bless you. All that I have\\r\\nsaid will come true].’[91]\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘This,’ I answered, ‘must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me\\r\\nand tell me true, I see my poor mother’s ghost close by us; she is sitting by\\r\\nthe blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does not\\r\\nremember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can make her know me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That,’ said he, ‘I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the blood\\r\\nwill talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let them have any\\r\\nblood they will go away again.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for his\\r\\nprophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until my mother\\r\\ncame up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me,\\r\\nsaying, ‘My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are\\r\\nstill alive? It is a hard thing for the living to see these places, for between\\r\\nus and them there are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no\\r\\nman can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all\\r\\nthis time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got\\r\\nback to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Mother,’ said I, ‘I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of the\\r\\nTheban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean land nor set\\r\\nfoot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one long series of\\r\\nmisfortunes from the very first day that I set out with Agamemnon for Ilius,\\r\\nthe land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans. But tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nin what way did you die? Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe\\r\\nyou a gentle easy passage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the\\r\\nson whom I left behind me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one\\r\\nelse got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me\\r\\nagain what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with\\r\\nmy son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she could\\r\\nand married again?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mother answered, ‘Your wife still remains in your house, but she is in\\r\\ngreat distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night and day.\\r\\nNo one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and Telemachus still\\r\\nholds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain largely, as of course he\\r\\nmust, considering his position as a magistrate,[92] and how every one invites him; your\\r\\nfather remains at his old place in the country and never goes near the town. He\\r\\nhas no comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in\\r\\nfront of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when\\r\\nthe warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine\\r\\nleaves thrown any how upon the ground. He grieves continually about your never\\r\\nhaving come home, and suffers more and more as he grows older. As for my own\\r\\nend it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my\\r\\nown house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear\\r\\npeople out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing and the\\r\\nforce of my affection for you—this it was that was the death of me.’[93]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother’s ghost. Thrice I\\r\\nsprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each time she flitted\\r\\nfrom my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being touched to the quick I\\r\\nsaid to her, ‘Mother, why do you not stay still when I would embrace you? If we\\r\\ncould throw our arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the\\r\\nsharing of our sorrows even in the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay\\r\\na still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My son,’ she answered, ‘most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not Proserpine\\r\\nthat is beguiling you, but all people are like this when they are dead. The\\r\\nsinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these perish in the\\r\\nfierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the body, and the soul\\r\\nflits away as though it were a dream. Now, however, go back to the light of day\\r\\nas soon as you can, and note all these things that you may tell them to your\\r\\nwife hereafter.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the wives and\\r\\ndaughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds about the blood,\\r\\nand I considered how I might question them severally. In the end I deemed that\\r\\nit would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep\\r\\nthem from all drinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other,\\r\\nand each one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of Cretheus\\r\\nthe son of Aeolus.[94] She fell in love with the river\\r\\nEnipeus who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she\\r\\nwas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover, lay\\r\\nwith her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave arched itself like a\\r\\nmountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he loosed her virgin\\r\\ngirdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god had accomplished the deed\\r\\nof love, he took her hand in his own and said, ‘Tyro, rejoice in all good will;\\r\\nthe embraces of the gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about\\r\\nthis time twelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home,\\r\\nbut hold your tongue and do not tell any one.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and Neleus, who\\r\\nboth of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a great breeder of\\r\\nsheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in Pylos. The rest of her\\r\\nchildren were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a\\r\\nmighty warrior and charioteer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of having slept\\r\\nin the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two sons Amphion and Zethus.\\r\\nThese founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built a wall all round it; for\\r\\nstrong though they were they could not hold Thebes till they had walled it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove indomitable\\r\\nHercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon, and married the\\r\\nredoubtable son of Amphitryon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it was to\\r\\nmarry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after having killed his\\r\\nfather, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world; whereon he\\r\\nremained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite the gods had borne him;\\r\\nbut Epicaste went to the house of the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged\\r\\nherself for grief, and the avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged\\r\\nmother—to his ruing bitterly thereafter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given priceless\\r\\npresents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of Iasus and king of\\r\\nMinyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore Nestor, Chromius, and\\r\\nPericlymenus, and she also bore that marvellously lovely woman Pero, who was\\r\\nwooed by all the country round; but Neleus would only give her to him who\\r\\nshould raid the cattle of Iphicles from the grazing grounds of Phylace, and\\r\\nthis was a hard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a\\r\\ncertain excellent seer,[95] but the will of heaven was against\\r\\nhim, for the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison;\\r\\nnevertheless when a full year had passed and the same season came round again,\\r\\nIphicles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven.\\r\\nThus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons, Castor\\r\\nbreaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these heroes are lying\\r\\nunder the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special dispensation of\\r\\nJove, they die and come to life again, each one of them every other day\\r\\nthroughout all time, and they have the rank of gods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of Neptune.\\r\\nShe bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short lived. They were the\\r\\nfinest children that were ever born in this world, and the best looking, Orion\\r\\nonly excepted; for at nine years old they were nine fathoms high, and measured\\r\\nnine cubits round the chest. They threatened to make war with the gods in\\r\\nOlympus, and tried to set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount\\r\\nPelion on the top of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would\\r\\nhave done it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed\\r\\nboth of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks\\r\\nor chin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the magician\\r\\nMinos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, but he did not enjoy\\r\\nher, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the island of Dia on account\\r\\nof what Bacchus had said against her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own husband\\r\\nfor gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name every single one of\\r\\nthe wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is time for me to go to\\r\\nbed, either on board ship with my crew, or here. As for my escort, heaven and\\r\\nyourselves will see to it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless\\r\\nthroughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good looking,\\r\\nand is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you share in the\\r\\ndistinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor niggardly in the\\r\\npresents you make to one who is in such great need, for heaven has blessed all\\r\\nof you with great abundance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among them, “My\\r\\nfriends,” said he, “what our august queen has just said to us is both\\r\\nreasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it; but the decision\\r\\nwhether in word or deed rests ultimately with King Alcinous.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The thing shall be done,” exclaimed Alcinous, “as surely as I still live and\\r\\nreign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to get home, still\\r\\nwe must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow, by which time I shall\\r\\nbe able to get together the whole sum that I mean to give him. As regards his\\r\\nescort it will be a matter for you all, and mine above all others as the chief\\r\\nperson among you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay here for a\\r\\nwhole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded with your noble gifts,\\r\\nI should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to my advantage, for I\\r\\nshould return fuller-handed to my own people, and should thus be more respected\\r\\nand beloved by all who see me when I get back to Ithaca.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” replied Alcinous, “not one of us who sees you has any idea that you\\r\\nare a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people going about who\\r\\ntell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see through them, but there\\r\\nis a style about your language which assures me of your good disposition.\\r\\nMoreover you have told the story of your own misfortunes, and those of the\\r\\nArgives, as though you were a practiced bard; but tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nwhether you saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same time with\\r\\nyourself, and perished there. The evenings are still at their longest, and it\\r\\nis not yet bed time—go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay\\r\\nhere listening till tomorrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell us\\r\\nof your adventures.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alcinous,” answered Ulysses, “there is a time for making speeches, and a time\\r\\nfor going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I will not refrain from\\r\\ntelling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades who did not fall\\r\\nfighting with the Trojans, but perished on their return, through the treachery\\r\\nof a wicked woman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the ghost\\r\\nof Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up to me, surrounded by those who had\\r\\nperished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as he had tasted the\\r\\nblood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to\\r\\nembrace me; but he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept and\\r\\npitied him as I beheld him. ‘How did you come by your death,’ said I, ‘King\\r\\nAgamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you when you were at\\r\\nsea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the main land when you were\\r\\ncattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of\\r\\ntheir wives and city?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ulysses,’ he answered, ‘noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea in any\\r\\nstorm of Neptune’s raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the mainland, but\\r\\nAegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between them. He asked me to\\r\\nhis house, feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably as though I were a\\r\\nfat beast in a slaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like\\r\\nsheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some\\r\\ngreat nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general\\r\\nengagement, or in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable\\r\\nas the way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the\\r\\nloaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I heard\\r\\nPriam’s daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I\\r\\nlay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands to kill\\r\\nthe slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she would not even close\\r\\nmy lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so\\r\\ncruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers\\r\\nwas. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home\\r\\nby my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace\\r\\non herself and all women who shall come after—even on the good ones.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to last in\\r\\nthe matter of their women’s counsels. See how many of us fell for Helen’s sake,\\r\\nand now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief against you too during your\\r\\nabsence.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Be sure, therefore,’ continued Agamemnon, ‘and not be too friendly even with\\r\\nyour own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly well yourself. Tell\\r\\nher a part only, and keep your own counsel about the rest. Not that your wife,\\r\\nUlysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a very admirable woman, and\\r\\nhas an excellent nature. We left her a young bride with an infant at her breast\\r\\nwhen we set out for Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man’s\\r\\nestate,[96] and he\\r\\nand his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is\\r\\nright they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me the\\r\\nhappiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I could do so. Furthermore\\r\\nI say—and lay my saying to your heart—do not tell people when you are bringing\\r\\nyour ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is\\r\\nno trusting women. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news\\r\\nof my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with\\r\\nMenelaus—for I presume that he is still living.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your son is\\r\\nalive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not know.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the ghost of\\r\\nAchilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax who was the finest\\r\\nand goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus. The fleet\\r\\ndescendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Ulysses, noble son\\r\\nof Laertes, what deed of daring will you undertake next, that you venture down\\r\\nto the house of Hades among us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that\\r\\ncan labour no more?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, I\\r\\ncame to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me about my return home\\r\\nto Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near the Achaean land, nor to\\r\\nset foot in my own country, but have been in trouble all the time. As for you,\\r\\nAchilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be,\\r\\nfor you were adored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that\\r\\nyou are here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it\\r\\nso much to heart even if you are dead.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Say not a word,’ he answered, ‘in death’s favour; I would rather be a paid\\r\\nservant in a poor man’s house and be above ground than king of kings among the\\r\\ndead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the wars and will he be a\\r\\ngreat soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if you have heard anything about\\r\\nmy father Peleus—does he still rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no\\r\\nrespect throughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him?\\r\\nCould I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that\\r\\nI had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy—could I but\\r\\nbe as I then was and go even for a short time to my father’s house, any one who\\r\\ntried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I have heard nothing,’ I answered, ‘of Peleus, but I can tell you all about\\r\\nyour son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros with the\\r\\nAchaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always first to speak, and\\r\\nhis judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the only two who could surpass\\r\\nhim; and when it came to fighting on the plain of Troy, he would never remain\\r\\nwith the body of his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all\\r\\nin valour. Many a man did he kill in battle—I cannot name every single one of\\r\\nthose whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say\\r\\nhow he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the\\r\\nhandsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell\\r\\naround him by reason of a woman’s bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the\\r\\nArgives went inside the horse that Epeus had made, and it was left to me to\\r\\nsettle when we should either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it,\\r\\nthough all the other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying their\\r\\neyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear\\r\\nfrom his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the\\r\\nhorse—grasping the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing\\r\\nfury against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his\\r\\nhandsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the fortune of\\r\\nwar) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat,\\r\\nfor the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a meadow\\r\\nfull of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the prowess of his\\r\\nson.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own melancholy\\r\\ntale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof—still angry with me for\\r\\nhaving won the cause in our dispute about the armour of Achilles. Thetis had\\r\\noffered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges.\\r\\nWould that I had never gained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life\\r\\nof Ajax, who was foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in\\r\\nstature and prowess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, ‘Ajax, will you not forget and\\r\\nforgive even in death, but must the judgement about that hateful armour still\\r\\nrankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to lose such a tower of\\r\\nstrength as you were to us. We mourned you as much as we mourned Achilles son\\r\\nof Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which\\r\\nJove bore against the Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your\\r\\ndestruction—come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection,\\r\\nand hear what I can tell you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts;\\r\\nnevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being so angry,\\r\\nor I should have gone on talking to him,[97] only that there were still others\\r\\namong the dead whom I desired to see.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand sitting in\\r\\njudgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting and standing round\\r\\nhim in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his sentences upon them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the ghosts of\\r\\nthe wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he had a great\\r\\nbronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some nine\\r\\nacres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were digging their beaks\\r\\ninto his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands, but\\r\\ncould not; for he had violated Jove’s mistress Leto as she was going through\\r\\nPanopeus on her way to Pytho.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that reached his\\r\\nchin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never reach the water, for\\r\\nwhenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it dried up and vanished, so that\\r\\nthere was nothing but dry ground—parched by the spite of heaven. There were\\r\\ntall trees, moreover, that shed their fruit over his head—pears, pomegranates,\\r\\napples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched\\r\\nout his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to the\\r\\nclouds.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both\\r\\nhis hands. With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the top of the hill,\\r\\nbut always, just before he could roll it over on to the other side, its weight\\r\\nwould be too much for him, and the pitiless stone[98] would come thundering down again on\\r\\nto the plain. Then he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the\\r\\nsweat ran off him and the steam rose after him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he is\\r\\nfeasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to wife, who is\\r\\ndaughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him like scared\\r\\nbirds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with his bare bow in his\\r\\nhands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as though ever on the point\\r\\nof taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the\\r\\nmost marvellous fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes;\\r\\nthere was also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what he\\r\\nmight, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew me at once\\r\\nwhen he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, ‘My poor Ulysses, noble son of\\r\\nLaertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was\\r\\nabove ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of suffering,\\r\\nfor I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me—a low fellow who set me all\\r\\nmanner of labours. He once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound—for he did not\\r\\nthink he could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound out\\r\\nof Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed where I\\r\\nwas in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me. And I should have\\r\\nseen still other of them that are gone before, whom I would fain have\\r\\nseen—Theseus and Pirithous—glorious children of the gods, but so many thousands\\r\\nof ghosts came round me and uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic\\r\\nstricken lest Proserpine should send up from the house of Hades the head of\\r\\nthat awful monster Gorgon. On this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my\\r\\nmen to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took\\r\\ntheir places, whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We\\r\\nhad to row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XII\\n\\r\\nTHE SIRENS, SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS, THE CATTLE OF THE SUN.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the open sea,\\r\\nwe went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is dawn and sun-rise\\r\\nas in other places. We then drew our ship on to the sands and got out of her on\\r\\nto the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day should break.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent some men\\r\\nto Circe’s house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood from a wood\\r\\nwhere the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had wept over him and\\r\\nlamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his body and armour had been\\r\\nburned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the\\r\\ncairn we fixed the oar that he had been used to row with.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back from the\\r\\nhouse of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as she could; and her\\r\\nmaid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine. Then she stood\\r\\nin the midst of us and said, ‘You have done a bold thing in going down alive to\\r\\nthe house of Hades, and you will have died twice, to other people’s once; now,\\r\\nthen, stay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with your\\r\\nvoyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about\\r\\nyour course, and will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering\\r\\nfrom misadventure either by land or sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day to the\\r\\ngoing down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on dark, the men\\r\\nlaid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship. Then Circe took\\r\\nme by the hand and bade me be seated away from the others, while she reclined\\r\\nby my side and asked me all about our adventures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘So far so good,’ said she, when I had ended my story, ‘and now pay attention\\r\\nto what I am about to tell you—heaven itself, indeed, will recall it to your\\r\\nrecollection. First you will come to the Sirens who enchant all who come near\\r\\nthem. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of the\\r\\nSirens, his wife and children will never welcome him home again, for they sit\\r\\nin a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song.\\r\\nThere is a great heap of dead men’s bones lying all around, with the flesh\\r\\nstill rotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men’s\\r\\nears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen\\r\\nyourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross\\r\\npiece half way up the mast,[99] and they must lash the rope’s ends to\\r\\nthe mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and\\r\\npray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you coherent\\r\\ndirections[100]\\r\\nas to which of two courses you are to take; I will lay the two alternatives\\r\\nbefore you, and you must consider them for yourself. On the one hand there are\\r\\nsome overhanging rocks against which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat\\r\\nwith terrific fury; the blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not\\r\\neven a bird may pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to\\r\\nFather Jove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove\\r\\nhas to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to\\r\\nthese rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are\\r\\nfreighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel that\\r\\never sailed and got through, was the famous Argo on her way from the house of\\r\\nAetes, and she too would have gone against these great rocks, only that Juno\\r\\npiloted her past them for the love she bore to Jason.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark\\r\\ncloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not even in summer\\r\\nand early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and twenty feet could get a\\r\\nfoothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had\\r\\nbeen polished. In the middle of it there is a large cavern, looking West and\\r\\nturned towards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is so\\r\\nhigh up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside\\r\\nit Scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young\\r\\nhound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one—not even a god—could\\r\\nface her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and six\\r\\nnecks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck she has a\\r\\nfrightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very close together,\\r\\nso that they would crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep\\r\\nwithin her shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,\\r\\nfishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can catch, of\\r\\nthe thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her\\r\\nwithout losing some men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries\\r\\noff a man in each mouth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are so close together that\\r\\nthere is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large fig tree in full\\r\\nleaf[101] grows\\r\\nupon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in\\r\\nthe day does she vomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down\\r\\nagain; see that you be not there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune\\r\\nhimself could not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as\\r\\nfast as you can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Is there no way,’ said I, ‘of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time\\r\\nkeeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You dare devil,’ replied the goddess, ‘you are always wanting to fight\\r\\nsomebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even by the\\r\\nimmortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme, rude,\\r\\ncruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best chance will be to get\\r\\nby her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle about her rock while you are\\r\\nputting on your armour, she may catch you with a second cast of her six heads,\\r\\nand snap up another half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full\\r\\nspeed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla’s dam, bad luck to her;\\r\\nshe will then stop her from making a second raid upon you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see many herds\\r\\nof cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god—seven herds of cattle\\r\\nand seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each flock. They do not breed,\\r\\nnor do they become fewer in number, and they are tended by the goddesses\\r\\nPhaethusa and Lampetie, who are children of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera.\\r\\nTheir mother when she had borne them and had done suckling them sent them to\\r\\nthe Thrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and look after\\r\\ntheir father’s flocks and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think\\r\\nof nothing but getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but\\r\\nif you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and\\r\\nof your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will return\\r\\nlate, in bad plight, after losing all your men.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven, whereon\\r\\nshe returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to loose the ship\\r\\nfrom her moorings; so they at once got into her, took their places, and began\\r\\nto smite the grey sea with their oars. Presently the great and cunning goddess\\r\\nCirce befriended us with a fair wind that blew dead aft, and staid steadily\\r\\nwith us, keeping our sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the\\r\\nship’s gear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, ‘My friends, it is not\\r\\nright that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies that Circe has\\r\\nmade me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that whether we live or die\\r\\nwe may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were to keep clear of the\\r\\nSirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a field of flowers; but she said I\\r\\nmight hear them myself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind\\r\\nme to the crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a\\r\\nbond so fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope’s ends to the\\r\\nmast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly\\r\\nstill.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached the\\r\\nisland of the two Sirens,[102] for the wind had been very\\r\\nfavourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of\\r\\nwind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails and stowed them;\\r\\nthen taking to their oars they whitened the water with the foam they raised in\\r\\nrowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small with my\\r\\nsword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till it became soft, which it\\r\\nsoon did between the kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then\\r\\nI stopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast\\r\\nas I stood upright on the cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When\\r\\nwe had got within earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate,\\r\\nthe Sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Come here,’ they sang, ‘renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean name, and\\r\\nlisten to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without staying to hear\\r\\nthe enchanting sweetness of our song—and he who listens will go on his way not\\r\\nonly charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills that the gods laid upon the\\r\\nArgives and Trojans before Troy, and can tell you everything that is going to\\r\\nhappen over the whole world.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them further I\\r\\nmade signs by frowning to my men that they should set me free; but they\\r\\nquickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me with still\\r\\nstronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens’ voices. Then my\\r\\nmen took the wax from their ears and unbound me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from which\\r\\nspray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were so frightened\\r\\nthat they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea resounded with the\\r\\nrushing of the waters,[103] but the ship stayed where it was,\\r\\nfor the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and exhorted them man\\r\\nby man not to lose heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘this is not the first time that we have been in danger,\\r\\nand we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops shut us up in his\\r\\ncave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved us then, and we shall\\r\\nlive to look back on all this as well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say,\\r\\ntrust in Jove and row on with might and main. As for you, coxswain, these are\\r\\nyour orders; attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away\\r\\nfrom these steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and\\r\\nbe over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster Scylla,\\r\\nfor I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did, but would huddle together\\r\\nin the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe’s strict instructions—I put\\r\\non my armour. Then seizing two strong spears I took my stand on the ship’s\\r\\nbows, for it was there that I expected first to see the monster of the rock,\\r\\nwho was to do my men so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere,\\r\\nthough I strained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand was\\r\\nScylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt water. As she\\r\\nvomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when it is boiling over upon\\r\\na great fire, and the spray reached the top of the rocks on either side. When\\r\\nshe began to suck again, we could see the water all inside whirling round and\\r\\nround, and it made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could\\r\\nsee the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were\\r\\nat their wits ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were\\r\\nexpecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and\\r\\nsnatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and\\r\\nin a moment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in the\\r\\nair as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one\\r\\nlast despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting\\r\\nrock[104] throws\\r\\nbait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the\\r\\nox’s horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as\\r\\nhe catches them one by one—even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on\\r\\nher rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and\\r\\nstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most\\r\\nsickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible Charybdis,\\r\\nwe reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the goodly cattle and\\r\\nsheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could bear\\r\\nthe cattle lowing as they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then\\r\\nI remembered what the blind Theban prophet Teiresias had told me, and how\\r\\ncarefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god.\\r\\nSo being much troubled I said to the men, ‘My men, I know you are hard pressed,\\r\\nbut listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how\\r\\ncarefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for\\r\\nit was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship,\\r\\ntherefore, away from the island.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an insolent\\r\\nanswer. ‘Ulysses,’ said he, ‘you are cruel; you are very strong yourself and\\r\\nnever get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now, though your men are\\r\\nexhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not let them land and cook\\r\\nthemselves a good supper upon this island, but bid them put out to sea and go\\r\\nfaring fruitlessly on through the watches of the flying night. It is by night\\r\\nthat the winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one\\r\\nof those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so often wreck\\r\\na vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey\\r\\nthe behests of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to-morrow\\r\\nmorning we will go on board again and put out to sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that heaven meant\\r\\nus a mischief and said, ‘You force me to yield, for you are many against one,\\r\\nbut at any rate each one of you must take his solemn oath that if he meet with\\r\\na herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a\\r\\nsingle head of either, but will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given\\r\\nus.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath we made\\r\\nthe ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh water, and the men\\r\\nwent ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\\r\\ndrink, they began talking about their poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up\\r\\nand eaten; this set them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off\\r\\ninto a sound sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their places, Jove\\r\\nraised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that land and sea were\\r\\ncovered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. When the\\r\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land and\\r\\ndrew her into a cave wherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I\\r\\ncalled the men together in council.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind,\\r\\ntherefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for these\\r\\ncattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear to\\r\\neverything.’ And again they promised that they would obey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was no\\r\\nother wind, but only South and East.[105] As long as corn and wine held out\\r\\nthe men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when, however, they had\\r\\neaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to go further afield, with\\r\\nhook and line, catching birds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands\\r\\non; for they were starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that I might\\r\\npray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough\\r\\nto be clear of all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from\\r\\nthe wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by and\\r\\nby they sent me off into a sweet sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men, ‘Listen to me,’\\r\\nsaid he, ‘my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there is none so bad\\r\\nas famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these cows and offer them in\\r\\nsacrifice to the immortal gods? If we ever get back to Ithaca, we can build a\\r\\nfine temple to the sun-god and enrich it with every kind of ornament; if,\\r\\nhowever, he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for these horned\\r\\ncattle, and the other gods are of the same mind, I for one would rather drink\\r\\nsalt water once for all and have done with it, than be starved to death by\\r\\ninches in such a desert island as this is.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle, so fair\\r\\nand goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men, therefore, drove in\\r\\nthe best of them, and they all stood round them saying their prayers, and using\\r\\nyoung oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there was no barley left. When\\r\\nthey had done praying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they\\r\\ncut out the thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some\\r\\npieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make\\r\\ndrink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring\\r\\non a little water from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled;\\r\\nthen, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats,\\r\\nthey cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship and to\\r\\nthe sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast meat, so I groaned out\\r\\na prayer to the immortal gods. ‘Father Jove,’ I exclaimed, ‘and all you other\\r\\ngods who live in everlasting bliss, you have done me a cruel mischief by the\\r\\nsleep into which you have sent me; see what fine work these men of mine have\\r\\nbeen making in my absence.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had been\\r\\nkilling his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said to the immortals,\\r\\n‘Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, I must have\\r\\nvengeance on the crew of Ulysses’ ship: they have had the insolence to kill my\\r\\ncows, which were the one thing I loved to look upon, whether I was going up\\r\\nheaven or down again. If they do not square accounts with me about my cows, I\\r\\nwill go down to Hades and shine there among the dead.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Sun,’ said Jove, ‘go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over the\\r\\nfruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a bolt of\\r\\nwhite lightning as soon as they get out to sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from the mouth of\\r\\nMercury.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each one of\\r\\nthe men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for the cows were dead\\r\\nalready. And indeed the gods began at once to show signs and wonders among us,\\r\\nfor the hides of the cattle crawled about, and the joints upon the spits began\\r\\nto low like cows, and the meat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise\\r\\njust as cows do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon them, but\\r\\nwhen Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the fury of the gale\\r\\nabated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts, spread sail, and put out\\r\\nto sea. As soon as we were well away from the island, and could see nothing but\\r\\nsky and sea, the son of Saturn raised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea\\r\\ngrew dark beneath it. We did not get on much further, for in another moment we\\r\\nwere caught by a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of\\r\\nthe mast so that it fell aft, while all the ship’s gear tumbled about at the\\r\\nbottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the ship’s\\r\\nstern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell\\r\\noverboard as though he were diving, with no more life left in him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round and round,\\r\\nand was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men all\\r\\nfell into the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship, looking\\r\\nlike so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of\\r\\ngetting home again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel (which\\r\\ndrifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the direction of the\\r\\nkeel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging about it, and\\r\\nwith this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting astride of them was\\r\\ncarried wherever the winds chose to take me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into the\\r\\nSouth again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back to the terrible\\r\\nwhirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually happened, for I was borne\\r\\nalong by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reached the rock of Scylla,\\r\\nand the whirlpool. She was then sucking down the salt sea water,[106] but I was\\r\\ncarried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like\\r\\na bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the\\r\\nroots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were\\r\\ntoo high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently\\r\\non, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again—and a very\\r\\nlong while it seemed. A jury-man is not more glad to get home to supper, after\\r\\nhaving been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my\\r\\nraft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go\\r\\nwith my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, hard by my raft on to\\r\\nwhich I then got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of\\r\\ngods and men would not let her get further sight of me—otherwise I should have\\r\\ncertainly been lost.[107]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the gods\\r\\nstranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and powerful goddess\\r\\nCalypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I need say no more about this,\\r\\nfor I told you and your noble wife all about it yesterday, and I hate saying\\r\\nthe same thing over and over again.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIII\\n\\r\\nULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered\\r\\ncloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous began\\r\\nto speak.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” said he, “now that you have reached my house I doubt not you will\\r\\nget home without further misadventure no matter how much you have suffered in\\r\\nthe past. To you others, however, who come here night after night to drink my\\r\\nchoicest wine and listen to my bard, I would insist as follows. Our guest has\\r\\nalready packed up the clothes, wrought gold,[108] and other valuables which you have\\r\\nbrought for his acceptance; let us now, therefore, present him further, each\\r\\none of us, with a large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the\\r\\nlevy of a general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the\\r\\nburden of such a handsome present.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEvery one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in his own\\r\\nabode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they hurried\\r\\ndown to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them. Alcinous went on board\\r\\nand saw everything so securely stowed under the ship’s benches that nothing\\r\\ncould break adrift and injure the rowers. Then they went to the house of\\r\\nAlcinous to get dinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who\\r\\nis the lord of all. They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner,\\r\\nafter which the inspired bard, Demodocus, who was a favourite with every one,\\r\\nsang to them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as though\\r\\nto hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on his way. As one who has been\\r\\nall day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his\\r\\nsupper and is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for it is all\\r\\nhis legs can do to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went\\r\\ndown, and he at once said to the Phaeacians, addressing himself more\\r\\nparticularly to King Alcinous:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me on my way\\r\\nrejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart’s desire by giving me an escort, and\\r\\nmaking me presents, which heaven grant that I may turn to good account; may I\\r\\nfind my admirable wife living in peace among friends,[109] and may you whom I leave behind me\\r\\ngive satisfaction to your wives and children;[110] may heaven vouchsafe you every good\\r\\ngrace, and may no evil thing come among your people.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and agreed that\\r\\nhe should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Alcinous\\r\\ntherefore said to his servant, “Pontonous, mix some wine and hand it round to\\r\\neverybody, that we may offer a prayer to father Jove, and speed our guest upon\\r\\nhis way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others each\\r\\nfrom his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that live in\\r\\nheaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands of queen Arete.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Farewell, queen,” said he, “henceforward and for ever, till age and death, the\\r\\ncommon lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take my leave; be happy\\r\\nin this house with your children, your people, and with king Alcinous.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to conduct him to\\r\\nhis ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some maidservants with him—one\\r\\nwith a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong box, and a third with\\r\\ncorn and wine. When they got to the water side the crew took these things and\\r\\nput them on board, with all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a\\r\\nrug and a linen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the\\r\\nship. Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew took\\r\\nevery man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which it\\r\\nhad been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing out to sea, Ulysses fell into a\\r\\ndeep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber.[111]\\n\\n\\r\\nThe ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies over the\\r\\ncourse when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetted as it were the neck of\\r\\na stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water seethed in her wake. She held\\r\\nsteadily on her course, and even a falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not\\r\\nhave kept pace with her. Thus, then, she cut her way through the water,\\r\\ncarrying one who was as cunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping\\r\\npeacefully, forgetful of all that he had suffered both on the field of battle\\r\\nand by the waves of the weary sea.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show, the ship\\r\\ndrew near to land.[112] Now there is in Ithaca a haven of\\r\\nthe old merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line of\\r\\nthe sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of wind and\\r\\nsea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a ship may lie without\\r\\nbeing even moored. At the head of this harbour there is a large olive tree, and\\r\\nat no great distance a fine overarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are\\r\\ncalled Naiads.[113] There are mixing bowls within it\\r\\nand wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover, there are great\\r\\nlooms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of sea purple—very curious\\r\\nto see—and at all times there is water within it. It has two entrances, one\\r\\nfacing North by which mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes\\r\\nfrom the South and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it\\r\\nis the way taken by the gods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nInto this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the place.[114] She had so\\r\\nmuch way upon her that she ran half her own length on to the shore;[115] when, however,\\r\\nthey had landed, the first thing they did was to lift Ulysses with his rug and\\r\\nlinen sheet out of the ship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep.\\r\\nThen they took out the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to\\r\\ngive him when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all\\r\\ntogether by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear some\\r\\npasser by[116]\\r\\nmight come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and then they made the best of\\r\\ntheir way home again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already threatened\\r\\nUlysses, so he took counsel with Jove. “Father Jove,” said he, “I shall no\\r\\nlonger be held in any sort of respect among you gods, if mortals like the\\r\\nPhaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show such small regard for me. I\\r\\nsaid I would let Ulysses get home when he had suffered sufficiently. I did not\\r\\nsay that he should never get home at all, for I knew you had already nodded\\r\\nyour head about it, and promised that he should do so; but now they have\\r\\nbrought him in a ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading\\r\\nhim with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he would\\r\\never have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of the spoil and got\\r\\nhome without misadventure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Jove answered, “What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking about? The\\r\\ngods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would be monstrous were\\r\\nthey to insult one so old and honoured as you are. As regards mortals, however,\\r\\nif any of them is indulging in insolence and treating you disrespectfully, it\\r\\nwill always rest with yourself to deal with him as you may think proper, so do\\r\\njust as you please.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should have done so at once,” replied Neptune, “if I were not anxious to\\r\\navoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should like to wreck\\r\\nthe Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its escort. This will stop them from\\r\\nescorting people in future; and I should also like to bury their city under a\\r\\nhuge mountain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My good friend,” answered Jove, “I should recommend you at the very moment\\r\\nwhen the people from the city are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into\\r\\na rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will astonish everybody, and\\r\\nyou can then bury their city under the mountain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the\\r\\nPhaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid way,\\r\\nhad got close in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and drove it\\r\\ndown with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground. After this he\\r\\nwent away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn towards\\r\\nhis neighbour, saying, “Bless my heart, who is it that can have rooted the ship\\r\\nin the sea just as she was getting into port? We could see the whole of her\\r\\nonly a moment ago.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous said, “I\\r\\nremember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that Neptune would be angry\\r\\nwith us for taking every one so safely over the sea, and would one day wreck a\\r\\nPhaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, and bury our city under a\\r\\nhigh mountain. This was what my old father used to say, and now it is all\\r\\ncoming true.[117]\\r\\nNow therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off\\r\\ngiving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice\\r\\ntwelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not bury our\\r\\ncity under the high mountain.” When the people heard this they were afraid and\\r\\ngot ready the bulls.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to king Neptune, standing\\r\\nround his altar; and at the same time[118] Ulysses woke up once more upon his\\r\\nown soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again; moreover,\\r\\nJove’s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that people might not know\\r\\nof his having come, and that she might tell him everything without either his\\r\\nwife or his fellow citizens and friends recognising him[119] until he had taken his revenge upon\\r\\nthe wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him—the\\r\\nlong straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly trees,\\r\\nappeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native land. So he\\r\\nsmote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” he exclaimed, “among what manner of people am I fallen? Are they savage\\r\\nand uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put all this treasure,\\r\\nand which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over there with the Phaeacians; or\\r\\nI could have gone to some other great chief who would have been good to me and\\r\\ngiven me an escort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I\\r\\ncannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good\\r\\ntruth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by\\r\\nme, and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to\\r\\nIthaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants chastise\\r\\nthem, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I\\r\\nsuppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his clothes, but\\r\\nthere was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not being in his own\\r\\ncountry, and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea bewailing\\r\\nhis hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of\\r\\ndelicate and princely mien, with a good cloak folded double about her\\r\\nshoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand.\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he saw her, and went straight up to her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” said he, “you are the first person whom I have met with in this\\r\\ncountry; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed towards me.\\r\\nProtect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your knees and pray to\\r\\nyou as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and\\r\\ncountry is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea\\r\\nboard of some continent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come from\\r\\nsomewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is a very\\r\\ncelebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is rugged and not a\\r\\ngood driving country, but it is by no means a bad island for what there is of\\r\\nit. It grows any quantity of corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain\\r\\nand dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and\\r\\nthere are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of\\r\\nIthaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off\\r\\nfrom this Achaean country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own country,\\r\\nand he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and made up a lying\\r\\nstory in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I heard of Ithaca,” said he, “when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and now it\\r\\nseems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as much more\\r\\nbehind me for my children, but am flying because I killed Orsilochus son of\\r\\nIdomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him because he wanted to rob\\r\\nme of the spoils I had got from Troy with so much trouble and danger both on\\r\\nthe field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served\\r\\nhis father loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent\\r\\nruler, so I lay in wait for him with one of my followers by the road side, and\\r\\nspeared him as he was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark\\r\\nnight and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him,\\r\\nbut as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were\\r\\nPhoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis where the\\r\\nEpeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile,\\r\\nbut the wind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither\\r\\nby night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none of us said\\r\\na word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay\\r\\ndown just as we were. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took\\r\\nmy goods out of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the\\r\\nsand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress\\r\\nof mind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand. Then she\\r\\ntook the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, “He must be indeed a shifty\\r\\nlying fellow,” said she, “who could surpass you in all manner of craft even\\r\\nthough you had a god for your antagonist. Dare devil that you are, full of\\r\\nguile, unwearying in deceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive\\r\\nfalsehood, even now that you are in your own country again? We will say no\\r\\nmore, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive upon occasion—you are\\r\\nthe most accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for\\r\\ndiplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not know Jove’s\\r\\ndaughter Minerva—me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch over you in\\r\\nall your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you?\\r\\nAnd now, again, I am come here to talk things over with you, and help you to\\r\\nhide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the\\r\\ntroubles that await you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell\\r\\nno one, neither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything,\\r\\nand put up with every man’s insolence, without a word.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so\\r\\nconstantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is a hard matter\\r\\nfor him to know whether it is you or not. This much, however, I know\\r\\nexceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans were fighting\\r\\nbefore Troy, but from the day on which we went on board ship after having\\r\\nsacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed us—from that day, Minerva, I saw\\r\\nno more of you, and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a\\r\\ndifficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from\\r\\nevil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took\\r\\nme into the town.[120] And now, I beseech you in your\\r\\nfather’s name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in\\r\\nIthaca. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in\\r\\nall you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own\\r\\ncountry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are always taking something of that sort in your head,” replied Minerva,\\r\\n“and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you are so plausible,\\r\\nshrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning from so long a voyage\\r\\nwould at once have gone home to see his wife and children, but you do not seem\\r\\nto care about asking after them or hearing any news about them till you have\\r\\nexploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no\\r\\npeace night or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming\\r\\nnear you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back\\r\\nsafely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with\\r\\nmy uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded his son.[121] I will now,\\r\\nhowever, point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps\\r\\nbelieve me. This is the haven of the old merman Phorcys, and here is the olive\\r\\ntree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;[122] here too is\\r\\nthe overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to\\r\\nthe nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then Ulysses\\r\\nrejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed the bounteous\\r\\nsoil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying, “Naiad nymphs,\\r\\ndaughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never again to see you, now therefore\\r\\nI greet you with all loving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in\\r\\nthe old days, if Jove’s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my\\r\\nson to manhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,” rejoined Minerva, “let us\\r\\nrather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where they will be\\r\\nquite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding places,\\r\\nwhile Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and good clothing\\r\\nwhich the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed everything carefully away, and\\r\\nMinerva set a stone against the door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the\\r\\nroot of the great olive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the\\r\\nwicked suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” said Minerva, “noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay hands on\\r\\nthese disreputable people who have been lording it in your house these three\\r\\nyears, courting your wife and making wedding presents to her, while she does\\r\\nnothing but lament your absence, giving hope and sending encouraging messages[123] to every one\\r\\nof them, but meaning the very opposite of all she says.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have come to\\r\\nmuch the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you had not given me\\r\\nsuch timely information. Advise me how I shall best avenge myself. Stand by my\\r\\nside and put your courage into my heart as on the day when we loosed Troy’s\\r\\nfair diadem from her brow. Help me now as you did then, and I will fight three\\r\\nhundred men, if you, goddess, will be with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Trust me for that,” said she, “I will not lose sight of you when once we set\\r\\nabout it, and I imagine that some of those who are devouring your substance\\r\\nwill then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains. I will begin by\\r\\ndisguising you so that no human being shall know you; I will cover your body\\r\\nwith wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a\\r\\ngarment that shall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine\\r\\neyes for you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of\\r\\nyour wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then go at once to the\\r\\nswineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected\\r\\ntowards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding\\r\\nhis pigs near the rock that is called Raven[124] by the fountain Arethusa, where\\r\\nthey are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their manner. Stay with\\r\\nhim and find out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your\\r\\nson, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out\\r\\nwhether you are still alive.”[125]\\n\\n\\r\\n“But why,” said Ulysses, “did you not tell him, for you knew all about it? Did\\r\\nyou want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others\\r\\nare eating up his estate?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be well\\r\\nspoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but is staying quite\\r\\ncomfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with abundance of every kind. The\\r\\nsuitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him, for they mean to\\r\\nkill him before he can get home. I do not much think they will succeed, but\\r\\nrather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a\\r\\ngrave themselves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with wrinkles,\\r\\ntook away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over his whole body; she\\r\\nbleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones; she changed his clothes\\r\\nand threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and\\r\\nbegrimed with smoke; she also gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer\\r\\ngarment, and furnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a\\r\\ntwisted thong for him to sling it over his shoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess went\\r\\nstraight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIV\\n\\r\\nULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the wooded\\r\\ncountry and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the place where\\r\\nMinerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was the most thrifty\\r\\nservant he had. He found him sitting in front of his hut, which was by the\\r\\nyards that he had built on a site which could be seen from far. He had made\\r\\nthem spacious[126] and fair to see, with a free run\\r\\nfor the pigs all round them; he had built them during his master’s absence, of\\r\\nstones which he had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to\\r\\nPenelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside\\r\\nthe yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close\\r\\ntogether, while inside he had built twelve styes near one another for the sows\\r\\nto lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding\\r\\nsows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the\\r\\nsuitors kept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he had\\r\\ncontinually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman’s\\r\\nfour hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. The\\r\\nswineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals[127] from a good\\r\\nstout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place or\\r\\nanother, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he had been forced\\r\\nto send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at him, but\\r\\nUlysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of the stick that he\\r\\nhad in his hand: still, he would have been torn by them in his own homestead\\r\\nhad not the swineherd dropped his ox hide, rushed full speed through the gate\\r\\nof the yard and driven the dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them.\\r\\nThen he said to Ulysses, “Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work\\r\\nof you, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me\\r\\nquite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am\\r\\nin continual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people to\\r\\neat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving in some\\r\\ndistant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill of bread and\\r\\nwine, tell me where you come from, and all about your misfortunes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down. He\\r\\nstrewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of this he\\r\\nthrew the shaggy chamois skin—a great thick one—on which he used to sleep by\\r\\nnight. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said “May Jove, sir,\\r\\nand the rest of the gods grant you your heart’s desire in return for the kind\\r\\nway in which you have received me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Stranger, though a still poorer man\\r\\nshould come here, it would not be right for me to insult him, for all strangers\\r\\nand beggars are from Jove. You must take what you can get and be thankful, for\\r\\nservants live in fear when they have young lords for their masters; and this is\\r\\nmy misfortune now, for heaven has hindered the return of him who would have\\r\\nbeen always good to me and given me something of my own—a house, a piece of\\r\\nland, a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant\\r\\nwho has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they\\r\\nhave mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he\\r\\nwould have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen’s\\r\\nwhole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a good\\r\\nman. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds,\\r\\nto fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where the young\\r\\nsucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought back with him and\\r\\nsacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted them; when the meat was\\r\\ncooked he brought it all in and set it before Ulysses, hot and still on the\\r\\nspit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd\\r\\nthen mixed wine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told\\r\\nhim to begin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fall to, stranger,” said he, “on a dish of servant’s pork. The fat pigs have\\r\\nto go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but the blessed\\r\\ngods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do what is lawful and\\r\\nright. Even the fierce freebooters who go raiding on other people’s land, and\\r\\nJove gives them their spoil—even they, when they have filled their ships and\\r\\ngot home again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but\\r\\nsome god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\\r\\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of\\r\\nmarriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without fear or\\r\\nstint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not one\\r\\nvictim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly\\r\\nrich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he\\r\\nwas; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had.\\r\\nThere are twelve herds of cattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of\\r\\nsheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired\\r\\nstrangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he\\r\\nruns even large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in\\r\\nthe charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the\\r\\nbest goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs\\r\\nthat you see here, and I have to keep picking out the best I have and sending\\r\\nit to them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously without\\r\\na word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was satisfied, the\\r\\nswineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank, filled it with wine, and\\r\\ngave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said as he took it in his hands, “My\\r\\nfriend, who was this master of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich\\r\\nand so powerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King\\r\\nAgamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove\\r\\nand the other gods know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have\\r\\ntravelled much.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEumaeus answered, “Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will get\\r\\nUlysses’ wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in want of a\\r\\nlodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a word of truth;\\r\\nevery one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress and tells her\\r\\nfalsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them, and asks them all\\r\\nmanner of questions, crying all the time as women will when they have lost\\r\\ntheir husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless\\r\\nmake up a very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since\\r\\ntorn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones\\r\\nare lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and\\r\\na bad business it is for all his friends—for me especially; go where I may I\\r\\nshall never find so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother\\r\\nand father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my\\r\\nparents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own country;\\r\\nit is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without\\r\\nreverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and took\\r\\nsuch care of me that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” replied Ulysses, “you are very positive, and very hard of belief\\r\\nabout your master’s coming home again, nevertheless I will not merely say, but\\r\\nwill swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything for my news till he has\\r\\nactually come, you may then give me a shirt and cloak of good wear if you will.\\r\\nI am in great want, but I will not take anything at all till then, for I hate a\\r\\nman, even as I hate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I\\r\\nswear by king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses\\r\\nto which I have now come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will.\\r\\nUlysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\\r\\nbeginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who are ill\\r\\ntreating his wife and son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Old man, you will neither get paid\\r\\nfor bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink your wine in\\r\\npeace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on reminding me of all\\r\\nthis; it always pains me when any one speaks about my honoured master. As for\\r\\nyour oath we will let it alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope,\\r\\nhis old father Laertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about\\r\\nthis same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be\\r\\nno worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or\\r\\nman, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get\\r\\nnews of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming\\r\\nhome, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca.\\r\\nBut let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape\\r\\nif the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man,\\r\\ntell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and where\\r\\nyou come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came\\r\\nin, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what country they professed to\\r\\ncome—for you cannot have come by land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “I will tell you all about it. If there were meat and\\r\\nwine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do but to eat\\r\\nand drink while the others go to their work, I could easily talk on for a whole\\r\\ntwelve months without ever finishing the story of the sorrows with which it has\\r\\npleased heaven to visit me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many sons born\\r\\nin marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had purchased for a\\r\\nconcubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax (whose lineage I claim,\\r\\nand who was held in the highest honour among the Cretans for his wealth,\\r\\nprosperity, and the valour of his sons) put me on the same level with my\\r\\nbrothers who had been born in wedlock. When, however, death took him to the\\r\\nhouse of Hades, his sons divided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but\\r\\nto me they gave a holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me\\r\\nto marry into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on\\r\\nthe field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you\\r\\ncan see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and\\r\\nMinerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the enemy\\r\\nwith an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was the first to\\r\\nleap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I\\r\\ndid not care about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring\\r\\nup children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows—things\\r\\nthat most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another\\r\\nanother, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the\\r\\nAchaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign\\r\\nservice, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first\\r\\ninstance, and much more was allotted to me later on.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but when Jove\\r\\ncounselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished, the people\\r\\nrequired me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy, and there was no way out\\r\\nof it, for they insisted on our doing so. There we fought for nine whole years,\\r\\nbut in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven\\r\\ndispersed us. Then it was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one\\r\\nmonth happily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the\\r\\nidea of making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it.\\r\\nI had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my\\r\\nmen made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods\\r\\nand for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail from\\r\\nCrete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a river.\\r\\nNothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but\\r\\nsat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On\\r\\nthe fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the\\r\\nriver, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while I sent out\\r\\nscouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the\\r\\nland of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children\\r\\ncaptive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the war\\r\\ncry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with horsemen\\r\\nand foot soldiers and with the gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my\\r\\nmen, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves\\r\\nsurrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do\\r\\nforced labour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus—and I wish\\r\\nI had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store\\r\\nfor me—I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then\\r\\nI went straight up to the king’s chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them,\\r\\nwhereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took me weeping to\\r\\nhis own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kill me in\\r\\ntheir fury, but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the\\r\\nprotector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\\r\\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on for\\r\\neight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who had already\\r\\ncommitted all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over into going with\\r\\nhim to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions lay. I stayed there for a\\r\\nwhole twelve months, but at the end of that time when months and days had gone\\r\\nby till the same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound\\r\\nfor Libya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that\\r\\nplace, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I\\r\\nfetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not\\r\\nhelp it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea that lies\\r\\nbetween Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled their destruction, for\\r\\nas soon as we were well out from Crete and could see nothing but sea and sky,\\r\\nhe raised a black cloud over our ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then\\r\\nJove let fly with his thunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was\\r\\nfilled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all\\r\\ninto the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like\\r\\nso many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting\\r\\nhome again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship’s mast within my\\r\\nreach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted before the fury of\\r\\nthe gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great\\r\\nwave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the\\r\\nThesprotians entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all—for\\r\\nhis son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he\\r\\nraised me by the hand, took me to his father’s house and gave me clothes to\\r\\nwear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had\\r\\nentertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his homeward\\r\\njourney. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought iron that Ulysses\\r\\nhad got together. There was enough to keep his family for ten generations, so\\r\\nmuch had he left in the house of king Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had\\r\\ngone to Dodona that he might learn Jove’s mind from the god’s high oak tree,\\r\\nand know whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or\\r\\nin secret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in\\r\\nhis own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew\\r\\nfound, that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before\\r\\nUlysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the\\r\\nwheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge of her to be\\r\\nsure and take me safely to King Acastus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the very\\r\\nextreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from land they\\r\\nresolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt and cloak that\\r\\nI was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old clouts in which you now see\\r\\nme; then, towards nightfall, they reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there\\r\\nthey bound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to\\r\\nget supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having\\r\\ndrawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck\\r\\nout and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood\\r\\nin which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and went\\r\\nsearching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further use and\\r\\nwent back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me\\r\\nto a good man’s door—for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Poor unhappy stranger, I have found\\r\\nthe story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that part about\\r\\nUlysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe it. Why should a man\\r\\nlike you go about telling lies in this way? I know all about the return of my\\r\\nmaster. The gods one and all of them detest him, or they would have taken him\\r\\nbefore Troy, or let him die with friends around him when the days of his\\r\\nfighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\\r\\nashes and his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the storm winds\\r\\nhave spirited him away we know not whither.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the town\\r\\nunless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news about Ulysses.\\r\\nThen they all sit round and ask questions, both those who grieve over the\\r\\nking’s absence, and those who rejoice at it because they can eat up his\\r\\nproperty without paying for it. For my own part I have never cared about asking\\r\\nanyone else since the time when I was taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a\\r\\nman and come a long way till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind\\r\\nto him. He said he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting\\r\\nhis ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the\\r\\nfollowing summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much\\r\\nwealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my\\r\\ndoor, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any\\r\\nsuch reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the\\r\\ngod of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have given you\\r\\nmy oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a bargain, and call\\r\\nall the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master comes home, give me a\\r\\ncloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to Dulichium where I want to go; but\\r\\nif he does not come as I say he will, set your men on to me, and tell them to\\r\\nthrow me from yonder precipice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the\\r\\ncountry telling lies.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And a pretty figure I should cut then,” replied Eumaeus, “both now and\\r\\nhereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and showing\\r\\nyou hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest if I did; but\\r\\nit is just supper time and I hope my men will come in directly, that we may\\r\\ncook something savoury for supper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the pigs,\\r\\nwhich were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a tremendous\\r\\nsquealing they made as they were being driven into them. But Eumaeus called to\\r\\nhis men and said, “Bring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice him for\\r\\nthis stranger, and we will take toll of him ourselves. We have had trouble\\r\\nenough this long time feeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine fat five\\r\\nyear old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not forget the gods,\\r\\nfor he was a man of good principles, so the first thing he did was to cut\\r\\nbristles from the pig’s face and throw them into the fire, praying to all the\\r\\ngods as he did so that Ulysses might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig\\r\\nwith a billet of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood,\\r\\nand stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it\\r\\nup, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the\\r\\nfat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut\\r\\nthe rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them\\r\\ntill they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they threw them on\\r\\nto the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then\\r\\nstood up to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he\\r\\nset apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did\\r\\nso; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices\\r\\ncut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much\\r\\npleased. “I hope, Eumaeus,” said he, “that Jove will be as well disposed\\r\\ntowards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like\\r\\nmyself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Eat, my good fellow, and enjoy your\\r\\nsupper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that, just as he thinks\\r\\nright, for he can do whatever he chooses.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice to\\r\\nthe immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the cup in the hands\\r\\nof Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius brought them their\\r\\nbread; the swineherd had brought this man on his own account from among the\\r\\nTaphians during his master’s absence, and had paid for him with his own money\\r\\nwithout saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their\\r\\nhands upon the good things that were before them, and when they had had enough\\r\\nto eat and drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all\\r\\nwent to bed after having made a hearty supper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It poured\\r\\nwithout ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is a wet\\r\\nquarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the excellent care\\r\\nhe took of him, would take off his own cloak and give it him, or make one of\\r\\nhis men give him one. “Listen to me,” said he, “Eumaeus and the rest of you;\\r\\nwhen I have said a prayer I will tell you something. It is the wine that makes\\r\\nme talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will\\r\\nmake him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave\\r\\nunspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were still young\\r\\nand strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses\\r\\nwere the leaders, but I was in command also, for the other two would have it\\r\\nso. When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our\\r\\narmour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood that grew\\r\\nabout the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell\\r\\nsmall and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime.\\r\\nThe others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough with\\r\\ntheir shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left my cloak behind\\r\\nme, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my\\r\\nshirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had\\r\\nshifted their places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and\\r\\nhe at once gave me his ear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ulysses,’ said I, ‘this cold will be the death of me, for I have no cloak;\\r\\nsome god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt, and I do not\\r\\nknow what to do.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following plan:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Keep still,’ said he in a low voice, ‘or the others will hear you.’ Then he\\r\\nraised his head on his elbow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We are a\\r\\nlong way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell Agamemnon to\\r\\nsend us up more men at once.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running to the\\r\\nships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough till morning.\\r\\nWould that I were still young and strong as I was in those days, for then some\\r\\none of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out of good will and for the\\r\\nrespect due to a brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my\\r\\nclothes are shabby.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, “Old man, you have told us an excellent story, and have\\r\\nsaid nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present, therefore,\\r\\nyou shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger in distress\\r\\nmay reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning you have to shake your own old\\r\\nrags about your body again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up\\r\\nhere, but every man has only one. When Ulysses’ son comes home again he will\\r\\ngive you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some goatskins and\\r\\nsheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Ulysses lay down, and\\r\\nEumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept for a change in\\r\\ncase of extraordinarily bad weather.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the swineherd\\r\\ndid not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready to go outside, and\\r\\nUlysses was glad to see that he looked after his property during his master’s\\r\\nabsence. First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders and put on a thick\\r\\ncloak to keep out the wind. He also took the skin of a large and well fed goat,\\r\\nand a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his\\r\\nrest where the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them\\r\\nshelter from the North wind.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XV\\n\\r\\nMINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON—HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS AT PYLOS\\r\\nAND BRINGS HIM TO ITHACA—ON LANDING HE GOES TO THE HUT OF EUMAEUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses’ son that he\\r\\nwas to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping in the forecourt\\r\\nof Menelaus’s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but Telemachus could get no\\r\\nrest all night for thinking of his unhappy father, so Minerva went close up to\\r\\nhim and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor leave\\r\\nyour property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat up\\r\\neverything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand. Ask\\r\\nMenelaus to send you home at once if you wish to find your excellent mother\\r\\nstill there when you get back. Her father and brothers are already urging her\\r\\nto marry Eurymachus, who has given her more than any of the others, and has\\r\\nbeen greatly increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have\\r\\nbeen taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are—they\\r\\nalways want to do the best they can for the man who marries them, and never\\r\\ngive another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their\\r\\nfather either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put\\r\\neverything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you have, until\\r\\nit shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of\\r\\nanother matter which you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors\\r\\nare lying in wait for you in the Strait[128] between Ithaca and Samos, and they\\r\\nmean to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\\r\\nsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up your\\r\\nproperty will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship\\r\\nwell away from the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will\\r\\nsend you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to\\r\\nthe town, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge of your\\r\\npigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night,\\r\\nand then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from\\r\\nPylos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with his heel\\r\\nto rouse him, and said, “Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the horses to the\\r\\nchariot, for we must set off home.”[129]\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Pisistratus said, “No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive in the\\r\\ndark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought his presents and\\r\\nput them in the chariot for us; and let him say good bye to us in the usual\\r\\nway. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a host who has shown him\\r\\nkindness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen, leaving\\r\\nHelen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put on his shirt as\\r\\nfast as he could, threw a great cloak over his shoulders, and went out to meet\\r\\nhim. “Menelaus,” said he, “let me go back now to my own country, for I want to\\r\\nget home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Menelaus answered, “Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not detain\\r\\nyou. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or too rude to\\r\\nhim. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a man go when he wants\\r\\nto do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to stay. One should\\r\\ntreat a guest well as long as he is in the house and speed him when he wants to\\r\\nleave it. Wait, then, till I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot,\\r\\nand till you have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a\\r\\nsufficient dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once\\r\\nmore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on such a\\r\\nlong journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour in Hellas or in\\r\\nthe Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will conduct you myself through all\\r\\nour principal cities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will\\r\\ngive us something—a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Menelaus,” replied Telemachus, “I want to go home at once, for when I came\\r\\naway I left my property without protection, and fear that while looking for my\\r\\nfather I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something valuable has been\\r\\nstolen during my absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to prepare a\\r\\nsufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At this moment\\r\\nEteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got up; so Menelaus\\r\\ntold him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he at once did. Then\\r\\nMenelaus went down into his fragrant store room,[130] not alone, but Helen went too, with\\r\\nMegapenthes. When he reached the place where the treasures of his house were\\r\\nkept, he selected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a\\r\\nsilver mixing bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely\\r\\ndresses which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was\\r\\nlargest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a\\r\\nstar, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. [131] Then they all came back through the\\r\\nhouse again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said, “Telemachus, may\\r\\nJove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely home according to your\\r\\ndesire. I will now present you with the finest and most precious piece of plate\\r\\nin all my house. It is a mixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is\\r\\ninlaid with gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians\\r\\nmade me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on\\r\\nmy return home. I should like to give it to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus, while\\r\\nMegapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before him. Hard by\\r\\nstood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I too, my son,” said she, “have something for you as a keepsake from the hand\\r\\nof Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day. Till then, get\\r\\nyour dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back rejoicing to your own\\r\\ncountry and to your home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then\\r\\nPisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as he did\\r\\nso. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the house, and they\\r\\nboth of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought them water in a\\r\\nbeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\\r\\nhands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an upper servant brought them\\r\\nbread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.\\r\\nEteoneus carved the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes\\r\\npoured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were\\r\\nbefore them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and\\r\\nPisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove\\r\\nout through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer\\r\\ncourt, and Menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right\\r\\nhand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in\\r\\nfront of the horses and pledged them, saying, “Farewell to both of you; see\\r\\nthat you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any\\r\\nfather could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We will be sure, sir,” answered Telemachus, “to tell him everything as soon as\\r\\nwe see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses returned when I get\\r\\nback to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great kindness you have shown\\r\\nme and of the many beautiful presents I am taking with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand—an eagle with a great\\r\\nwhite goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm yard—and all\\r\\nthe men and women were running after it and shouting. It came quite close up to\\r\\nthem and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses. When they saw\\r\\nit they were glad, and their hearts took comfort within them, whereon\\r\\nPisistratus said, “Tell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to make, but\\r\\nHelen was too quick for him and said, “I will read this matter as heaven has\\r\\nput it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come to pass. The eagle\\r\\ncame from the mountain where it was bred and has its nest, and in like manner\\r\\nUlysses, after having travelled far and suffered much, will return to take his\\r\\nrevenge—if indeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the\\r\\nsuitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May Jove so grant it,” replied Telemachus, “if it should prove to be so, I\\r\\nwill make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed through the\\r\\ntown towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon their necks and\\r\\ntravelled the whole day long till the sun set and darkness was over all the\\r\\nland. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles lived who was son of Ortilochus,\\r\\nthe son of Alpheus. There they passed the night and were treated hospitably.\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their\\r\\nhorses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner\\r\\ngateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus\\r\\nlashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came to\\r\\nPylos, and then Telemachus said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you. You\\r\\nknow our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both of an age,\\r\\nand this journey has brought us together still more closely; do not, therefore,\\r\\ntake me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go to your father’s house he\\r\\nwill try to keep me in the warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go\\r\\nhome at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he deemed\\r\\nit best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus’s beautiful\\r\\npresents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then he said, “Go on\\r\\nboard at once and tell your men to do so also before I can reach home to tell\\r\\nmy father. I know how obstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he\\r\\nwill come down here to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he\\r\\nwill be very angry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians and soon\\r\\nreached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and gave his orders.\\r\\n“Now, my men,” said he, “get everything in order on board the ship, and let us\\r\\nset out home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as\\r\\nTelemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva in the\\r\\nship’s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a seer, who was\\r\\nflying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was descended from Melampus,\\r\\nwho used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a great\\r\\nhouse, but he was driven into exile by the great and powerful king Neleus.\\r\\nNeleus seized his goods and held them for a whole year, during which he was a\\r\\nclose prisoner in the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both\\r\\non account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great\\r\\nsorrow that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped\\r\\nwith his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that\\r\\nhad been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he left\\r\\nthe country and went to Argos, where it was ordained that he should reign over\\r\\nmuch people. There he married, established himself, and had two famous sons\\r\\nAntiphates and Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of\\r\\nAmphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not\\r\\nlive to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman’s gifts. His\\r\\nsons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was\\r\\nfather to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus\\r\\nfor his beauty’s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made\\r\\nPolypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.\\r\\nHe quarrelled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia, where he remained\\r\\nand prophesied for all men.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was making\\r\\ndrink-offerings and praying in his ship. “Friend,” said he, “now that I find\\r\\nyou sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices themselves, and\\r\\nby the god to whom you make them, I pray you also by your own head and by those\\r\\nof your followers tell me the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence\\r\\nare you? Tell me also of your town and parents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus said, “I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and my\\r\\nfather is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come to some\\r\\nmiserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew together to see\\r\\nif I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a long time.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I too,” answered Theoclymenus, “am an exile, for I have killed a man of my own\\r\\nrace. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they have great power\\r\\namong the Argives. I am flying to escape death at their hands, and am thus\\r\\ndoomed to be a wanderer on the face of the earth. I am your suppliant; take me,\\r\\ntherefore, on board your ship that they may not kill me, for I know they are in\\r\\npursuit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will not refuse you,” replied Telemachus, “if you wish to join us. Come,\\r\\ntherefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according to what we\\r\\nhave.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he received Theoclymenus’ spear and laid it down on the deck of the\\r\\nship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus sit beside\\r\\nhim; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them to catch hold of the\\r\\nropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set the mast in its socket in the\\r\\ncross plank, raised it and made it fast with the forestays, and they hoisted\\r\\ntheir white sails with sheets of twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind\\r\\nthat blew fresh and strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible.\\r\\nThus then they passed by Crouni and Chalcis.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel made a\\r\\nquick passage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans rule. Telemachus\\r\\nthen headed her for the flying islands,[132] wondering within himself whether he\\r\\nshould escape death or should be taken prisoner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the hut, and\\r\\nthe men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat and drink, Ulysses\\r\\nbegan trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he would continue to treat\\r\\nhim kindly, and ask him to stay on at the station or pack him off to the city;\\r\\nso he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging about\\r\\nthe town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give me your\\r\\nadvice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me and show me the\\r\\nway. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs must, to see if any one\\r\\nwill give me a drink and a piece of bread. I should like also to go to the\\r\\nhouse of Ulysses and bring news of her husband to Queen Penelope. I could then\\r\\ngo about among the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give\\r\\nme a dinner. I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways.\\r\\nListen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury who gives\\r\\ngrace and good name to the works of all men, there is no one living who would\\r\\nmake a more handy servant than I should—to put fresh wood on the fire, chop\\r\\nfuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those services that poor men have\\r\\nto do for their betters.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. “Heaven help me,” he\\r\\nexclaimed, “what ever can have put such a notion as that into your head? If you\\r\\ngo near the suitors you will be undone to a certainty, for their pride and\\r\\ninsolence reach the very heavens. They would never think of taking a man like\\r\\nyou for a servant. Their servants are all young men, well dressed, wearing good\\r\\ncloaks and shirts, with well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the\\r\\ntables are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay\\r\\nwhere you are, then; you are not in anybody’s way; I do not mind your being\\r\\nhere, no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes home he will give\\r\\nyou a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you want to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to me, for\\r\\nhaving saved me from going about and getting into trouble; there is nothing\\r\\nworse than being always on the tramp; still, when men have once got low down in\\r\\nthe world they will go through a great deal on behalf of their miserable\\r\\nbellies. Since, however, you press me to stay here and await the return of\\r\\nTelemachus, tell me about Ulysses’ mother, and his father whom he left on the\\r\\nthreshold of old age when he set out for Troy. Are they still living or are\\r\\nthey already dead and in the house of Hades?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you all about them,” replied Eumaeus, “Laertes is still living and\\r\\nprays heaven to let him depart peacefully in his own house, for he is terribly\\r\\ndistressed about the absence of his son, and also about the death of his wife,\\r\\nwhich grieved him greatly and aged him more than anything else did. She came to\\r\\nan unhappy end[133] through sorrow for her son: may no\\r\\nfriend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me come to such an end as she did.\\r\\nAs long as she was still living, though she was always grieving, I used to like\\r\\nseeing her and asking her how she did, for she brought me up along with her\\r\\ndaughter Ctimene, the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together,\\r\\nand she made little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they\\r\\nsent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me, my\\r\\nmistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for my feet, and\\r\\nsent me off into the country, but she was just as fond of me as ever. This is\\r\\nall over now. Still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in the situation\\r\\nwhich I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can find something for\\r\\nany respectable stranger who comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or\\r\\ndeed out of my mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked\\r\\npeople. Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk with her;\\r\\nthey like to have something to eat and drink at the house, and something too to\\r\\ntake back with them into the country. This is what will keep servants in a good\\r\\nhumour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Then you must have been a very little fellow, Eumaeus, when\\r\\nyou were taken so far away from your home and parents. Tell me, and tell me\\r\\ntrue, was the city in which your father and mother lived sacked and pillaged,\\r\\nor did some enemies carry you off when you were alone tending sheep or cattle,\\r\\nship you off here, and sell you for whatever your master gave them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” replied Eumaeus, “as regards your question: sit still, make\\r\\nyourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The nights are now at\\r\\ntheir longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and sitting up talking\\r\\ntogether; you ought not to go to bed till bed time, too much sleep is as bad as\\r\\ntoo little; if any one of the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and\\r\\ndo so; he can then take my master’s pigs out when he has done breakfast in the\\r\\nmorning. We too will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one\\r\\nanother stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much, and\\r\\nbeen buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling the memory of\\r\\nsorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question, then, my tale is as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above Ortygia,[134] where the land\\r\\nbegins to turn round and look in another direction.[135] It is not very thickly peopled, but\\r\\nthe soil is good, with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds\\r\\nwith wine and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by\\r\\nany sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them\\r\\nwith his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country is\\r\\ndivided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a man comparable\\r\\nto the gods, reigned over both.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for the\\r\\nPhoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted with gewgaws\\r\\nof all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my father’s house,\\r\\nvery tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these scoundrels got hold of\\r\\nher one day when she was washing near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her\\r\\nin ways that no woman can resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The\\r\\nman who had seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on\\r\\nthis she told him her father’s name. ‘I come from Sidon,’ said she, ‘and am\\r\\ndaughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming into the\\r\\ntown from the country, some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the\\r\\nsea, where they sold me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them their\\r\\nprice for me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The man who had seduced her then said, ‘Would you like to come along with us\\r\\nto see the house of your parents and your parents themselves? They are both\\r\\nalive and are said to be well off.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I will do so gladly,’ answered she, ‘if you men will first swear me a solemn\\r\\noath that you will do me no harm by the way.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their oath the\\r\\nwoman said, ‘Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the street or at the\\r\\nwell, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one should go and tell my\\r\\nmaster, in which case he would suspect something. He would put me in prison,\\r\\nand would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your\\r\\nmerchandise as fast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. I\\r\\nwill bring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else\\r\\nalso that I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good\\r\\nman of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I will carry\\r\\nhim off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of money for him if you\\r\\ntake him and sell him in foreign parts.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole year till\\r\\nthey had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise, and then, when they\\r\\nhad got freight enough, they sent to tell the woman. Their messenger, a very\\r\\ncunning fellow, came to my father’s house bringing a necklace of gold with\\r\\namber beads strung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it in\\r\\ntheir hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the\\r\\nwoman and then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led\\r\\nme out of the house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with\\r\\nthe cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in attendance\\r\\non him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she\\r\\nsnatched up three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while I\\r\\nfollowed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over\\r\\nall the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,\\r\\nwhere the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they sailed\\r\\ntheir ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind;\\r\\nsix days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck\\r\\nthe woman and she fell heavily down into the ship’s hold as though she were a\\r\\nsea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and\\r\\nfishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and waves\\r\\ntook the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and\\r\\nthus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes with the\\r\\nmost lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as well as evil, for\\r\\nin spite of everything you have a good master, who sees that you always have\\r\\nenough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life, whereas I am still going\\r\\nabout begging my way from city to city.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for sleep,\\r\\nfor it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his crew were nearing\\r\\nland, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast, and rowed the ship into the\\r\\nharbour.[136]\\r\\nThey cast out their mooring stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out\\r\\nupon the sea shore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had\\r\\nhad enough to eat and drink Telemachus said, “Take the ship on to the town, but\\r\\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In the\\r\\nevening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the city, and\\r\\nto-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you all a good dinner\\r\\nwith meat and wine.” [137]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Theoclymenus said, “And what, my dear young friend, is to become of me? To\\r\\nwhose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or shall I go straight\\r\\nto your own house and to your mother?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At any other time,” replied Telemachus, “I should have bidden you go to my own\\r\\nhouse, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the present moment,\\r\\nhowever, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be away, and my mother\\r\\nwill not see you; she does not often show herself even to the suitors, but sits\\r\\nat her loom weaving in an upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a\\r\\nman whose house you can go to—I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held\\r\\nin the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and\\r\\nthe most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and\\r\\ntrying to take Ulysses’ place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows whether or\\r\\nno they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand—a hawk, Apollo’s\\r\\nmessenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore them\\r\\noff,[138] fell to\\r\\nthe ground midway between Telemachus and the ship. On this Theoclymenus called\\r\\nhim apart and caught him by the hand. “Telemachus,” said he, “that bird did not\\r\\nfly on your right hand without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I\\r\\nsaw it I knew it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that\\r\\nthere will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish it may prove so,” answered Telemachus. “If it does, I will show you so\\r\\nmuch good will and give you so many presents that all who meet you will\\r\\ncongratulate you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he said to his friend Piraeus, “Piraeus, son of Clytius, you have\\r\\nthroughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who have\\r\\naccompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to your own house\\r\\nand entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Piraeus answered, “Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you please, but\\r\\nI will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack of hospitality.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose the\\r\\nhawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus bound on his\\r\\nsandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head of sharpened bronze from\\r\\nthe deck of the ship. Then they loosed the hawsers, thrust the ship off from\\r\\nland, and made on towards the city as they had been told to do, while\\r\\nTelemachus strode on as fast as he could, till he reached the homestead where\\r\\nhis countless herds of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent\\r\\nswineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his master.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XVI\\n\\r\\nULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were were\\r\\ngetting breakfast ready at daybreak, for they had sent the men out with the\\r\\npigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark but fawned upon him, so\\r\\nUlysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing that the dogs did not bark,\\r\\nsaid to Eumaeus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of your\\r\\nacquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and not\\r\\nbarking.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the door.\\r\\nEumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing wine fell from\\r\\nhis hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his head and both his\\r\\nbeautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not be more delighted at the\\r\\nreturn of an only son, the child of his old age, after ten years’ absence in a\\r\\nforeign country and after having gone through much hardship. He embraced him,\\r\\nkissed him all over as though he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly\\r\\nto him saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I heard you\\r\\nhad gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you any more. Come in,\\r\\nmy dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good look at you now you are\\r\\nhome again; it is not very often you come into the country to see us herdsmen;\\r\\nyou stick pretty close to the town generally. I suppose you think it better to\\r\\nkeep an eye on what the suitors are doing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So be it, old friend,” answered Telemachus, “but I am come now because I want\\r\\nto see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her old home or whether\\r\\nsome one else has married her, so that the bed of Ulysses is without bedding\\r\\nand covered with cobwebs.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She is still at the house,” replied Eumaeus, “grieving and breaking her heart,\\r\\nand doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he took Telemachus’ spear, whereon he crossed the stone threshold\\r\\nand came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place as he entered,\\r\\nbut Telemachus checked him; “Sit down, stranger,” said he, “I can easily find\\r\\nanother seat, and there is one here who will lay it for me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green brushwood on\\r\\nthe floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus to sit upon. Then\\r\\nthe swineherd brought them platters of cold meat, the remains from what they\\r\\nhad eaten the day before, and he filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as\\r\\nhe could. He mixed wine also in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing\\r\\nUlysses. Then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them,\\r\\nand as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,\\r\\n“Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to\\r\\nIthaca, and who were they?—for assuredly he did not come here by land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “My son, I will tell you the real\\r\\ntruth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great traveller. At this\\r\\nmoment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship, and has taken refuge at my\\r\\nstation, so I will put him into your hands. Do whatever you like with him, only\\r\\nremember that he is your suppliant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am very much distressed,” said Telemachus, “by what you have just told me.\\r\\nHow can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young, and am not\\r\\nstrong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My mother cannot make up\\r\\nher mind whether to stay where she is and look after the house out of respect\\r\\nfor public opinion and the memory of her husband, or whether the time is now\\r\\ncome for her to take the best man of those who are wooing her, and the one who\\r\\nwill make her the most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to\\r\\nyour station I will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and\\r\\nsandals, and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep\\r\\nhim here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food that he may be no\\r\\nburden on you and on your men; but I will not have him go near the suitors, for\\r\\nthey are very insolent, and are sure to ill treat him in a way that would\\r\\ngreatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothing against\\r\\nnumbers, for they will be too strong for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said, “Sir, it is right that I should say something myself. I am\\r\\nmuch shocked about what you have said about the insolent way in which the\\r\\nsuitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are. Tell me, do you\\r\\nsubmit to such treatment tamely, or has some god set your people against you?\\r\\nMay you not complain of your brothers—for it is to these that a man may look\\r\\nfor support, however great his quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you\\r\\nare and in my present mind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses\\r\\nhimself, I would rather some one came and cut my head off, but I would go to\\r\\nthe house and be the bane of every one of these men.[139] If they were too many for me—I\\r\\nbeing single-handed—I would rather die fighting in my own house than see such\\r\\ndisgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men\\r\\ndragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn\\r\\nrecklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that shall never be\\r\\naccomplished.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Telemachus answered, “I will tell you truly everything. There is no enmity\\r\\nbetween me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to whom a man may\\r\\nlook for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove has made us a race of\\r\\nonly sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius, and Ulysses only son of\\r\\nLaertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses who left me behind him when he\\r\\nwent away, so that I have never been of any use to him. Hence it comes that my\\r\\nhouse is in the hands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the\\r\\nneighbouring islands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men\\r\\nof Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying court to\\r\\nmy mother, who will neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor yet\\r\\nbring matters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long\\r\\nwill do so with myself into the bargain. The issue, however, rests with heaven.\\r\\nBut do you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell Penelope that I am safe and\\r\\nhave returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself alone, and then come back here\\r\\nwithout letting any one else know, for there are many who are plotting mischief\\r\\nagainst me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I understand and heed you,” replied Eumaeus; “you need instruct me no further,\\r\\nonly as I am going that way say whether I had not better let poor Laertes know\\r\\nthat you are returned. He used to superintend the work on his farm in spite of\\r\\nhis bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he would eat and drink at will along with\\r\\nhis servants; but they tell me that from the day on which you set out for Pylos\\r\\nhe has neither eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his\\r\\nfarm, but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“More’s the pity,” answered Telemachus, “I am sorry for him, but we must leave\\r\\nhim to himself just now. If people could have everything their own way, the\\r\\nfirst thing I should choose would be the return of my father; but go, and give\\r\\nyour message; then make haste back again, and do not turn out of your way to\\r\\ntell Laertes. Tell my mother to send one of her women secretly with the news at\\r\\nonce, and let him hear it from her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals, bound\\r\\nthem to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched him well off the\\r\\nstation, and then came up to it in the form of a woman—fair, stately, and wise.\\r\\nShe stood against the side of the entry, and revealed herself to Ulysses, but\\r\\nTelemachus could not see her, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do\\r\\nnot let themselves be seen by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs,\\r\\nfor they did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of the\\r\\nyards. She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon\\r\\nhe left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the yards. Then\\r\\nshe said to him:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your son: do not\\r\\nkeep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the destruction of the\\r\\nsuitors, and then make for the town. I will not be long in joining you, for I\\r\\ntoo am eager for the fray.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a fair clean\\r\\nshirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him younger and of more\\r\\nimposing presence; she gave him back his colour, filled out his cheeks, and let\\r\\nhis beard become dark again. Then she went away and Ulysses came back inside\\r\\nthe hut. His son was astounded when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for\\r\\nfear he might be looking upon a god.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” said he, “how suddenly you have changed from what you were a moment\\r\\nor two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is not the same. Are\\r\\nyou some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If so, be propitious to\\r\\nme till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy\\r\\nupon me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses said, “I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am your\\r\\nfather, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands of lawless\\r\\nmen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to the ground,\\r\\nfor he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could not yet believe\\r\\nthat it was his father, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes that I\\r\\nmay grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself contrive to do as\\r\\nyou have been doing, and make yourself old and young at a moment’s notice,\\r\\nunless a god were with him. A second ago you were old and all in rags, and now\\r\\nyou are like some god come down from heaven.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably astonished\\r\\nat my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will come hereafter.\\r\\nSuch as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and much hardship have got home\\r\\nin the twentieth year to my own country. What you wonder at is the work of the\\r\\nredoubtable goddess Minerva, who does with me whatever she will, for she can do\\r\\nwhat she pleases. At one moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a\\r\\nyoung man with good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who\\r\\nlive in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father and\\r\\nwept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles or\\r\\nvultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half fledged young\\r\\nby peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the sun would have gone down\\r\\nupon their mourning if Telemachus had not suddenly said, “In what ship, my dear\\r\\nfather, did your crew bring you to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare\\r\\nthemselves to be—for you cannot have come by land?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you the truth, my son,” replied Ulysses. “It was the Phaeacians\\r\\nwho brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the habit of giving\\r\\nescorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took me over the sea while I\\r\\nwas fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after giving me many presents in\\r\\nbronze, gold, and raiment. These things by heaven’s mercy are lying concealed\\r\\nin a cave, and I am now come here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may\\r\\nconsult about killing our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the\\r\\nsuitors, with their number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can\\r\\nthen turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the\\r\\nwhole body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to help us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Telemachus answered, “Father, I have always heard of your renown both\\r\\nin the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a very great one: I am\\r\\nawed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand against many and brave\\r\\nones. There are not ten suitors only, nor twice ten, but ten many times over;\\r\\nyou shall learn their number at once. There are fifty-two chosen youths from\\r\\nDulichium, and they have six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty\\r\\nyoung Achaeans from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well\\r\\nborn. They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at\\r\\ntable. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue your\\r\\ncoming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some one who would be\\r\\nwilling to come and help us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Listen to me,” replied Ulysses, “and think whether Minerva and her father Jove\\r\\nmay seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some one else as well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Those whom you have named,” answered Telemachus, “are a couple of good allies,\\r\\nfor though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power over both gods\\r\\nand men.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These two,” continued Ulysses, “will not keep long out of the fray, when the\\r\\nsuitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return home early\\r\\nto-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before. Later on the\\r\\nswineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable old beggar. If you\\r\\nsee them ill treating me, steel your heart against my sufferings; even though\\r\\nthey drag me feet foremost out of the house, or throw things at me, look on and\\r\\ndo nothing beyond gently trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they\\r\\nwill not listen to you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore\\r\\nI say, and lay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I\\r\\nwill nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all the\\r\\narmour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room. Make some\\r\\nexcuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say that you have\\r\\ntaken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it\\r\\nwas when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add\\r\\nto this more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\\r\\nover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\\r\\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use\\r\\nthem. But leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of\\r\\noxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva\\r\\nwill then soon quiet these people. There is also another matter; if you are\\r\\nindeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is\\r\\nwithin the house—neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the\\r\\nservants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit the women alone,\\r\\nand let us also make trial of some other of the men servants, to see who is on\\r\\nour side and whose hand is against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father,” replied Telemachus, “you will come to know me by and by, and when you\\r\\ndo you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think, however, the\\r\\nplan you propose will turn out well for either of us. Think it over. It will\\r\\ntake us a long time to go the round of the farms and exploit the men, and all\\r\\nthe time the suitors will be wasting your estate with impunity and without\\r\\ncompunction. Prove the women by all means, to see who are disloyal and who\\r\\nguiltless, but I am not in favour of going round and trying the men. We can\\r\\nattend to that later on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will\\r\\nsupport you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought Telemachus and\\r\\nhis crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When they had come inside\\r\\nthe harbour they drew the ship on to the land; their servants came and took\\r\\ntheir armour from them, and they left all the presents at the house of Clytius.\\r\\nThen they sent a servant to tell Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the\\r\\ncountry, but had sent the ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed\\r\\nand made unhappy. This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both\\r\\non the same errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the\\r\\nservant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting women,\\r\\n“Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos”; but Eumaeus went close up to\\r\\nPenelope, and said privately all that her son had bidden him tell her. When he\\r\\nhad given his message he left the house with its outbuildings and went back to\\r\\nhis pigs again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they went outside\\r\\nthe great wall that ran round the outer court, and held a council near the main\\r\\nentrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first to speak.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friends,” said he, “this voyage of Telemachus’s is a very serious matter;\\r\\nwe had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however, let us draw a\\r\\nship into the water, and get a crew together to send after the others and tell\\r\\nthem to come back as fast as they can.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and saw the\\r\\nship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, and putting by their\\r\\noars; so he laughed, and said to the others, “We need not send them any\\r\\nmessage, for they are here. Some god must have told them, or else they saw the\\r\\nship go by, and could not overtake her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the ship on\\r\\nshore; their servants took their armour from them, and they went up in a body\\r\\nto the place of assembly, but they would not let any one old or young sit along\\r\\nwith them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke first.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens,” said he, “see how the gods have saved this man from\\r\\ndestruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day long,\\r\\nand when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but waited in the\\r\\nship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and killing him; but some\\r\\ngod has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us consider how we can make an\\r\\nend of him. He must not escape us; our affair is never likely to come off while\\r\\nhe is alive, for he is very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on\\r\\nour side. We must make haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he\\r\\nwill lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell\\r\\nall the world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to take him. The people\\r\\nwill not like this when they come to know of it; we must see that they do us no\\r\\nhurt, nor drive us from our own country into exile. Let us try and lay hold of\\r\\nhim either on his farm away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can\\r\\ndivide up his property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries\\r\\nher have the house. If this does not please you, and you wish Telemachus to\\r\\nlive on and hold his father’s property, then we must not gather here and eat up\\r\\nhis goods in this way, but must make our offers to Penelope each from his own\\r\\nhouse, and she can marry the man who will give the most for her, and whose lot\\r\\nit is to win her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the son of\\r\\nNisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the suitors\\r\\nfrom the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his conversation,\\r\\nmoreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any of the other suitors,\\r\\nfor he was a man of good natural disposition. “My friends,” said he, speaking\\r\\nto them plainly and in all honestly, “I am not in favour of killing Telemachus.\\r\\nIt is a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take\\r\\ncounsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to\\r\\nkill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us,\\r\\nI would have you hold your hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith and\\r\\nwent to the house of Ulysses, where they took their accustomed seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She knew of\\r\\nthe plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard their counsels\\r\\nand had told her; she went down therefore to the court attended by her maidens,\\r\\nand when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts\\r\\nsupporting the roof of the cloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked\\r\\nAntinous saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best speaker and\\r\\ncounsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are nothing of the kind.\\r\\nMadman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemachus, and take no heed\\r\\nof suppliants, whose witness is Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot\\r\\nthus against one another. Do you not remember how your father fled to this\\r\\nhouse in fear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone with\\r\\nsome Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us?\\r\\nThey wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\\r\\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his\\r\\nproperty without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife and\\r\\ntrying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others also.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, “Take heart, Queen Penelope\\r\\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters. The man\\r\\nis not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon your son\\r\\nTelemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth. I say—and it\\r\\nshall surely be—that my spear shall be reddened with his blood; for many a time\\r\\nhas Ulysses taken me on his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put\\r\\npieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I\\r\\nhave, and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death\\r\\ncomes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it.” He said this to quiet her,\\r\\nbut in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva shed\\r\\nsleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses and his son,\\r\\nwho had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were helping one another\\r\\nto get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an\\r\\nold man with a stroke of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for\\r\\nfear that the swineherd might recognise him and not keep the secret, but go and\\r\\ntell Penelope.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus was the first to speak. “So you have got back, Eumaeus,” said he.\\r\\n“What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are they still\\r\\nwaiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did not think of asking about that,” replied Eumaeus, “when I was in the\\r\\ntown. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I could. I met\\r\\na man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he was the first to\\r\\ntell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw with my own eyes; I had\\r\\njust got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury above the town when I saw a\\r\\nship coming into harbour with a number of men in her. They had many shields and\\r\\nspears, and I thought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus could not\\r\\nsee him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they ate it,\\r\\nand every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they\\r\\nhad had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XVII\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS AND HIS MOTHER MEET—ULYSSES AND EUMAEUS COME DOWN TO THE TOWN, AND\\r\\nULYSSES IS INSULTED BY MELANTHIUS—HE IS RECOGNISED BY THE DOG ARGOS—HE IS\\r\\nINSULTED AND PRESENTLY STRUCK BY ANTINOUS WITH A STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE\\r\\nSHALL BE SENT TO HER.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus bound on\\r\\nhis sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for he wanted to go\\r\\ninto the city. “Old friend,” said he to the swineherd, “I will now go to the\\r\\ntown and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off grieving till\\r\\nshe has seen me. As for this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let\\r\\nhim beg there of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have\\r\\ntrouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this\\r\\nmakes him angry so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said, “Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always do\\r\\nbetter in town than country, for any one who likes can give him something. I am\\r\\ntoo old to care about remaining here at the beck and call of a master.\\r\\nTherefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take me to the town as\\r\\nsoon as I have had a warm by the fire, and the day has got a little heat in it.\\r\\nMy clothes are wretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished\\r\\nwith cold, for you say the city is some way off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge upon the\\r\\nsuitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post of the\\r\\ncloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and went inside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting the\\r\\nfleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to him; all the\\r\\nother maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses.\\r\\nPenelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus, and wept as she\\r\\nflung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead and both his beautiful\\r\\neyes, “Light of my eyes,” she cried as she spoke fondly to him, “so you are\\r\\ncome home again; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of\\r\\nyour having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining my\\r\\nconsent. But come, tell me what you saw.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not scold me, mother,” answered Telemachus, “nor vex me, seeing what a\\r\\nnarrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress, go upstairs\\r\\nwith your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if\\r\\nJove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors. I must now go to the\\r\\nplace of assembly to invite a stranger who has come back with me from Pylos. I\\r\\nsent him on with my crew, and told Piraeus to take him home and look after him\\r\\ntill I could come for him myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe heeded her son’s words, washed her face, changed her dress, and vowed full\\r\\nand sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would only vouchsafe her\\r\\nrevenge upon the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand—not alone, for\\r\\nhis two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him with a presence of such\\r\\ndivine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went by, and the suitors\\r\\ngathered round him with fair words in their mouths and malice in their hearts;\\r\\nbut he avoided them, and went to sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses,\\r\\nold friends of his father’s house, and they made him tell them all that had\\r\\nhappened to him. Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted\\r\\nthrough the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once joined\\r\\nthem. Piraeus was first to speak: “Telemachus,” said he, “I wish you would send\\r\\nsome of your women to my house to take away the presents Menelaus gave you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We do not know, Piraeus,” answered Telemachus, “what may happen. If the\\r\\nsuitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them, I would\\r\\nrather you had the presents than that any of those people should get hold of\\r\\nthem. If on the other hand I managed to kill them, I shall be much obliged if\\r\\nyou will kindly bring me my presents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they got there\\r\\nthey laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the baths, and\\r\\nwashed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed them, and had given\\r\\nthem cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at table. A maid servant then\\r\\nbrought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver\\r\\nbasin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An\\r\\nupper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what\\r\\nthere was in the house. Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one\\r\\nof the bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands\\r\\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to\\r\\neat and drink Penelope said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which I have\\r\\nnot ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set out for Troy with\\r\\nthe sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear to me before the\\r\\nsuitors came back to the house, whether or no you had been able to hear\\r\\nanything about the return of your father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you then truth,” replied her son. “We went to Pylos and saw\\r\\nNestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as though I were\\r\\na son of his own who had just returned after a long absence; so also did his\\r\\nsons; but he said he had not heard a word from any human being about Ulysses,\\r\\nwhether he was alive or dead. He sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses\\r\\nto Menelaus. There I saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and\\r\\nTrojans, were in heaven’s wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it\\r\\nwas that had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth, whereon\\r\\nhe said, ‘So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind might\\r\\nas well lay her new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed\\r\\nin the forest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he comes back to his lair,\\r\\nwill make short work with the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these\\r\\nsuitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that\\r\\nhe was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily\\r\\nthat all the Greeks cheered him—if he is still such, and were to come near\\r\\nthese suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards\\r\\nyour question, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the\\r\\nold man of the sea told me, so much will I tell you in full. He said he could\\r\\nsee Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso,\\r\\nwho was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no\\r\\nships nor sailors to take him over the sea.’ This was what Menelaus told me,\\r\\nand when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave me a fair wind\\r\\nand soon brought me safe home again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus said to her:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things; listen\\r\\ntherefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide nothing from you.\\r\\nMay Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the rites of hospitality, with\\r\\nthat hearth of Ulysses to which I now come, that Ulysses himself is even now in\\r\\nIthaca, and, either going about the country or staying in one place, is\\r\\nenquiring into all these evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the\\r\\nsuitors. I saw an omen when I was on the ship which meant this, and I told\\r\\nTelemachus about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true, you shall\\r\\nhave such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall\\r\\ncongratulate you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or aiming\\r\\nwith spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the house, and\\r\\nbehaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now time for dinner, and\\r\\nthe flock of sheep and goats had come into the town from all the country round,\\r\\n[140] with their\\r\\nshepherds as usual, then Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited\\r\\nupon them at table, said, “Now then, my young masters, you have had enough\\r\\nsport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing,\\r\\nat dinner time.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the house,\\r\\nthey laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and then sacrificed\\r\\nsome sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and well grown.[141] Thus they made\\r\\nready for their meal. In the meantime Ulysses and the swineherd were about\\r\\nstarting for the town, and the swineherd said, “Stranger, I suppose you still\\r\\nwant to go to town to-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I\\r\\nshould have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my\\r\\nmaster tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one’s master\\r\\nis a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad day; it will\\r\\nbe night again directly and then you will find it colder.”[142]\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know, and understand you,” replied Ulysses; “you need say no more. Let us be\\r\\ngoing, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it to walk with, for you\\r\\nsay the road is a very rough one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders, by the\\r\\ncord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his liking. The two\\r\\nthen started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs and herdsmen who\\r\\nremained behind; the swineherd led the way and his master followed after,\\r\\nlooking like some broken down old tramp as he leaned upon his staff, and his\\r\\nclothes were all in rags. When they had got over the rough steep ground and\\r\\nwere nearing the city, they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew\\r\\ntheir water. This had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a\\r\\ngrove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the clear\\r\\ncold water came down to it from a rock high up,[143] while above the fountain there was\\r\\nan altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used to sacrifice. Here\\r\\nMelanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was driving down some goats, the\\r\\nbest in his flock, for the suitors’ dinner, and there were two shepherds with\\r\\nhim. When he saw Eumaeus and Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and\\r\\nunseemly language, which made Ulysses very angry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There you go,” cried he, “and a precious pair you are. See how heaven brings\\r\\nbirds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master swineherd, are\\r\\nyou taking this poor miserable object? It would make any one sick to see such a\\r\\ncreature at table. A fellow like this never won a prize for anything in his\\r\\nlife, but will go about rubbing his shoulders against every man’s door post,\\r\\nand begging, not for swords and cauldrons[144] like a man, but only for a few\\r\\nscraps not worth begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my\\r\\nstation, he might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to\\r\\nthe kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but he\\r\\nhas taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he will do\\r\\nnothing but beg victuals all the town over, to feed his insatiable belly. I\\r\\nsay, therefore—and it shall surely be—if he goes near Ulysses’ house he will\\r\\nget his head broken by the stools they will fling at him, till they turn him\\r\\nout.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure\\r\\nwantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path. For a\\r\\nmoment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him with his\\r\\nstaff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out; he resolved,\\r\\nhowever, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the swineherd looked\\r\\nstraight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his hands and praying to\\r\\nheaven as he did so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fountain nymphs,” he cried, “children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned you\\r\\nthigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my prayer that\\r\\nheaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to the swaggering threats\\r\\nwith which such men as you go about insulting people—gadding all over the town\\r\\nwhile your flocks are going to ruin through bad shepherding.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Melanthius the goatherd answered, “You ill conditioned cur, what are you\\r\\ntalking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship and take you to a\\r\\nforeign country, where I can sell you and pocket the money you will fetch. I\\r\\nwish I were as sure that Apollo would strike Telemachus dead this very day, or\\r\\nthat the suitors would kill him, as I am that Ulysses will never come home\\r\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went quickly\\r\\nforward and soon reached the house of his master. When he got there he went in\\r\\nand took his seat among the suitors opposite Eurymachus, who liked him better\\r\\nthan any of the others. The servants brought him a portion of meat, and an\\r\\nupper woman servant set bread before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses\\r\\nand the swineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music,\\r\\nfor Phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold\\r\\nof the swineherd’s hand, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far you go,\\r\\nyou will find few like it. One building keeps following on after another. The\\r\\nouter court has a wall with battlements all round it; the doors are double\\r\\nfolding, and of good workmanship; it would be a hard matter to take it by force\\r\\nof arms. I perceive, too, that there are many people banqueting within it, for\\r\\nthere is a smell of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods\\r\\nhave made to go along with feasting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Eumaeus said, “You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally do; but\\r\\nlet us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside first and join\\r\\nthe suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let me go in\\r\\nfirst? But do not wait long, or some one may see you loitering about outside,\\r\\nand throw something at you. Consider this matter I pray you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “I understand and heed. Go in first and leave me here\\r\\nwhere I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things thrown at me. I\\r\\nhave been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that I am case-hardened, and\\r\\nthis too may go with the rest. But a man cannot hide away the cravings of a\\r\\nhungry belly; this is an enemy which gives much trouble to all men; it is\\r\\nbecause of this that ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war\\r\\nupon other people.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and\\r\\npricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred before setting out\\r\\nfor Troy, but he had never had any work out of him. In the old days he used to\\r\\nbe taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or\\r\\nhares, but now that his master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of\\r\\nmule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should\\r\\ncome and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As\\r\\nsoon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail,\\r\\nbut he could not get close up to his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the\\r\\nother side of the yard, he dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus seeing\\r\\nit, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his build\\r\\nis splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one of those\\r\\ndogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for show?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This hound,” answered Eumaeus, “belonged to him who has died in a far country.\\r\\nIf he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would soon show you what\\r\\nhe could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from\\r\\nhim when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for\\r\\nhis master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never\\r\\ndo their work when their master’s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes\\r\\nhalf the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the suitors\\r\\nwere, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him to come\\r\\nand sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying near where the\\r\\ncarver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he picked it up, brought\\r\\nit to Telemachus’s table, and sat down opposite him. Then the servant brought\\r\\nhim his portion, and gave him bread from the bread-basket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor miserable old\\r\\nbeggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags. He sat down upon\\r\\nthe threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading from the outer to the\\r\\ninner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had\\r\\nskilfully planed, and had made to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus\\r\\ntook a whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in\\r\\nhis two hands, and said to Eumaeus, “Take this to the stranger, and tell him to\\r\\ngo the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be\\r\\nshamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, “Stranger, Telemachus sends you this, and\\r\\nsays you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for beggars must not be\\r\\nshamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and fulfil\\r\\nthe desire of his heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it on the\\r\\ndirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the bard was singing,\\r\\nand had just finished his dinner as he left off. The suitors applauded the\\r\\nbard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of\\r\\nbread from each one of the suitors, that he might see what kind of people they\\r\\nwere, and tell the good from the bad; but come what might she was not going to\\r\\nsave a single one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from\\r\\nleft to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real\\r\\nbeggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another\\r\\nwho he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius said,\\r\\n“Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I have\\r\\nseen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing about the\\r\\nman himself, nor where he comes from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. “You precious idiot,” he cried,\\r\\n“what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps and beggars\\r\\nenough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think it a small thing\\r\\nthat such people gather here to waste your master’s property—and must you needs\\r\\nbring this man as well?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, “Antinous, your birth is good but your words evil. It was\\r\\nno doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite a stranger from a\\r\\nforeign country, unless it be one of those who can do public service as a seer,\\r\\na healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who can charm us with his singing?\\r\\nSuch men are welcome all the world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar\\r\\nwho will only worry him. You are always harder on Ulysses’ servants than any of\\r\\nthe other suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as\\r\\nTelemachus and Penelope are alive and here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Telemachus said, “Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the bitterest\\r\\ntongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Antinous he said, “Antinous, you take as much care of my\\r\\ninterests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this stranger\\r\\nturned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and give it him\\r\\nyourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my mother, nor any\\r\\nof the other servants in the house; but I know you will not do what I say, for\\r\\nyou are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving them to other\\r\\npeople.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean, Telemachus,” replied Antinous, “by this swaggering talk? If\\r\\nall the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would not come here\\r\\nagain for another three months.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from under the\\r\\ntable, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but the other suitors\\r\\nall gave him something, and filled his wallet with bread and meat; he was\\r\\nabout, therefore, to go back to the threshold and eat what the suitors had\\r\\ngiven him, but he first went up to Antinous and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you seem to\\r\\nbe a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be the better giver,\\r\\nand I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a rich man once, and had\\r\\na fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am,\\r\\nno matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and\\r\\nall the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy,\\r\\nbut it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving\\r\\nrobbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my\\r\\nships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them and keep guard over\\r\\nthem, while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the\\r\\nland of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children\\r\\ncaptives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the\\r\\nwar-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with\\r\\nsoldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic\\r\\namong my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found\\r\\nthemselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive\\r\\nto do forced labour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met\\r\\nthem, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in\\r\\nCyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Antinous said, “What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague us\\r\\nduring our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,[145] or I will give\\r\\nyou Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity; you have\\r\\nbegged of all the others, and they have given you lavishly, for they have\\r\\nabundance round them, and it is easy to be free with other people’s property\\r\\nwhen there is plenty of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Ulysses began to move off, and said, “Your looks, my fine sir, are\\r\\nbetter than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would not spare a\\r\\npoor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in another man’s, and\\r\\nsurrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you to give him even a piece\\r\\nof bread.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, “You shall pay for\\r\\nthis before you get clear of the court.” With these words he threw a footstool\\r\\nat him, and hit him on the right shoulder blade near the top of his back.\\r\\nUlysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not even stagger him, but he\\r\\nshook his head in silence as he brooded on his revenge. Then he went back to\\r\\nthe threshold and sat down there, laying his well filled wallet at his feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Listen to me,” he cried, “you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even\\r\\nas I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets hit while fighting\\r\\nfor his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; and even so Antinous has hit me\\r\\nwhile in the service of my miserable belly, which is always getting people into\\r\\ntrouble. Still, if the poor have gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them\\r\\nthat Antinous may come to a bad end before his marriage.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off elsewhere,”\\r\\nshouted Antinous. “If you say more I will have you dragged hand and foot\\r\\nthrough the courts, and the servants shall flay you alive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young men said,\\r\\n“Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp: it will be\\r\\nworse for you if he should turn out to be some god—and we know the gods go\\r\\nabout disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign countries, and\\r\\ntravel about the world to see who do amiss and who righteously.”[146]\\n\\n\\r\\nThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile Telemachus was\\r\\nfurious about the blow that had been given to his father, and though no tear\\r\\nfell from him, he shook his head in silence and brooded on his revenge.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the\\r\\nbanqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, “Would that Apollo would so\\r\\nstrike you, Antinous,” and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, “If our prayers\\r\\nwere answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun rise.” Then\\r\\nPenelope said, “Nurse,[147] I hate every single one of them,\\r\\nfor they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like the darkness of\\r\\ndeath itself. A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the house for\\r\\nsheer want. Every one else has given him something to put in his wallet, but\\r\\nAntinous has hit him on the right shoulder-blade with a footstool.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in the\\r\\nmeantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the swineherd and\\r\\nsaid, “Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here, I want to see him and\\r\\nask him some questions. He seems to have travelled much, and he may have seen\\r\\nor heard something of my unhappy husband.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “If these Achaeans, Madam, would\\r\\nonly keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his adventures. I had\\r\\nhim three days and three nights with me in my hut, which was the first place he\\r\\nreached after running away from his ship, and he has not yet completed the\\r\\nstory of his misfortunes. If he had been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the\\r\\nwhole world, on whose lips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been\\r\\nmore charmed as I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old\\r\\nfriendship between his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete\\r\\nwhere the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither and\\r\\nthither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has heard of\\r\\nUlysses as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians, and that he is\\r\\nbringing great wealth home with him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Call him here, then,” said Penelope, “that I too may hear his story. As for\\r\\nthe suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they will, for they\\r\\nhave nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine remain unwasted in their houses\\r\\nwith none but servants to consume them, while they keep hanging about our house\\r\\nday after day sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets,\\r\\nand never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No\\r\\nestate can stand such recklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect us.\\r\\nIf he were to come again, he and his son would soon have their revenge.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded with\\r\\nit. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaeus, “Go and call the\\r\\nstranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I was speaking? This can\\r\\nonly mean that all the suitors are going to be killed, and that not one of them\\r\\nshall escape. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am\\r\\nsatisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and\\r\\ncloak of good wear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, “Father stranger,\\r\\nmy mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you; she is in great\\r\\ngrief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her about her husband, and\\r\\nif she is satisfied that you are speaking the truth, she will give you a shirt\\r\\nand cloak, which are the very things that you are most in want of. As for\\r\\nbread, you can get enough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the\\r\\ntown, and letting those give that will.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell Penelope,” answered Ulysses, “nothing but what is strictly true. I\\r\\nknow all about her husband, and have been partner with him in affliction, but I\\r\\nam afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel suitors, for their pride and\\r\\ninsolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover, as I was going about the house\\r\\nwithout doing any harm, a man gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but\\r\\nneither Telemachus nor any one else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to\\r\\nbe patient and wait till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire,\\r\\nfor my clothes are worn very thin—you know they are, for you have seen them\\r\\never since I first asked you to help me—she can then ask me about the return of\\r\\nher husband.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she saw him\\r\\ncross the threshold, “Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus? Is he afraid that\\r\\nsome one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside the house at all?\\r\\nBeggars should not be shamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “The stranger is quite reasonable.\\r\\nHe is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one else would do. He\\r\\nasks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much better, madam, that you\\r\\nshould have him all to yourself, when you can hear him and talk to him as you\\r\\nwill.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The man is no fool,” answered Penelope, “it would very likely be as he says,\\r\\nfor there are no such abominable people in the whole world as these men are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he had\\r\\nexplained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in his ear so that\\r\\nnone could overhear him, “My dear sir, I will now go back to the pigs, to see\\r\\nafter your property and my own business. You will look to what is going on\\r\\nhere, but above all be careful to keep out of danger, for there are many who\\r\\nbear you ill will. May Jove bring them to a bad end before they do us a\\r\\nmischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” replied Telemachus, “go home when you have had your dinner, and in\\r\\nthe morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice for the day. Leave\\r\\nthe rest to heaven and me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his dinner he\\r\\nleft the courts and the cloister with the men at table, and went back to his\\r\\npigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to amuse themselves with singing\\r\\nand dancing, for it was now getting on towards evening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XVIII\\n\\r\\nTHE FIGHT WITH IRUS—ULYSSES WARNS AMPHINOMUS—PENELOPE GETS PRESENTS FROM THE\\r\\nSUITORS—THE BRAZIERS—ULYSSES REBUKES EURYMACHUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over the city\\r\\nof Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and drunkard. This man\\r\\nhad no strength nor stay in him, but he was a great hulking fellow to look at;\\r\\nhis real name, the one his mother gave him, was Arnaeus, but the young men of\\r\\nthe place called him Irus,[148] because he used to run errands for\\r\\nany one who would send him. As soon as he came he began to insult Ulysses, and\\r\\nto try and drive him out of his own house.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Be off, old man,” he cried, “from the doorway, or you shall be dragged out\\r\\nneck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and\\r\\nwanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so? Get up then,\\r\\nand go of yourself, or we shall come to blows.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses frowned on him and said, “My friend, I do you no manner of harm; people\\r\\ngive you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room enough in this\\r\\ndoorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me things that are not\\r\\nyours to give. You seem to be just such another tramp as myself, but perhaps\\r\\nthe gods will give us better luck by and by. Do not, however, talk too much\\r\\nabout fighting or you will incense me, and old though I am, I shall cover your\\r\\nmouth and chest with blood. I shall have more peace tomorrow if I do, for you\\r\\nwill not come to the house of Ulysses any more.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIrus was very angry and answered, “You filthy glutton, you run on trippingly\\r\\nlike an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands about you, and knock\\r\\nyour teeth out of your head like so many boar’s tusks. Get ready, therefore,\\r\\nand let these people here stand by and look on. You will never be able to fight\\r\\none who is so much younger than yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front of the\\r\\ndoorway,[149] and\\r\\nwhen Antinous saw what was going on he laughed heartily and said to the others,\\r\\n“This is the finest sport that you ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything\\r\\nlike it into this house. The stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to\\r\\nfight, let us set them on to do so at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged tramps.\\r\\n“Listen to me,” said Antinous, “there are some goats’ paunches down at the\\r\\nfire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set aside for supper; he who\\r\\nis victorious and proves himself to be the better man shall have his pick of\\r\\nthe lot; he shall be free of our table and we will not allow any other beggar\\r\\nabout the house at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, said, “Sirs,\\r\\nan old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his own against a\\r\\nyoung one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though I know it can only\\r\\nend in my getting a drubbing. You must swear, however that none of you will\\r\\ngive me a foul blow to favour Irus and secure him the victory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath Telemachus\\r\\nput in a word and said, “Stranger, if you have a mind to settle with this\\r\\nfellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever strikes you will have\\r\\nto fight more than one. I am host, and the other chiefs, Antinous and\\r\\nEurymachus, both of them men of understanding, are of the same mind as I am.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins, thus\\r\\nbaring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his mighty arms;\\r\\nbut Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even stronger still. The suitors\\r\\nwere beyond measure astonished, and one would turn towards his neighbour\\r\\nsaying, “The stranger has brought such a thigh out of his old rags that there\\r\\nwill soon be nothing left of Irus.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIrus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded him by\\r\\nforce, and brought him [into the open part of the court] in such a fright that\\r\\nhis limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and said, “You swaggering\\r\\nbully, you ought never to have been born at all if you are afraid of such an\\r\\nold broken down creature as this tramp is. I say, therefore—and it shall surely\\r\\nbe—if he beats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack you off on\\r\\nboard ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills every one\\r\\nthat comes near him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your\\r\\nentrails for the dogs to eat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the middle of the\\r\\ncourt, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Ulysses considered\\r\\nwhether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an end of him then and\\r\\nthere, or whether he should give him a lighter blow that should only knock him\\r\\ndown; in the end he deemed it best to give the lighter blow for fear the\\r\\nAchaeans should begin to suspect who he was. Then they began to fight, and Irus\\r\\nhit Ulysses on the right shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck\\r\\nunder the ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing\\r\\nout of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking\\r\\non the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of\\r\\nlaughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot and dragged him into the\\r\\nouter court as far as the gate-house. There he propped him up against the wall\\r\\nand put his staff in his hands. “Sit here,” said he, “and keep the dogs and\\r\\npigs off; you are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king of\\r\\nthe beggars any more you shall fare still worse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn over his shoulder\\r\\nwith the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down upon the threshold;\\r\\nbut the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and saluting him, “May\\r\\nJove, and all the other gods,” said they, “grant you whatever you want for\\r\\nhaving put an end to the importunity of this insatiable tramp. We will take him\\r\\nover to the mainland presently, to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes\\r\\nnear him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat’s paunch\\r\\nbefore him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves out of the\\r\\nbread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he did so in a golden\\r\\ngoblet of wine. “Good luck to you,” he said, “father stranger, you are very\\r\\nbadly off at present, but I hope you will have better times by and by.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Ulysses answered, “Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of good\\r\\nunderstanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are. I have\\r\\nheard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man both brave\\r\\nand wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to be a considerable\\r\\nperson; listen, therefore, and take heed to what I am saying. Man is the\\r\\nvainest of all creatures that have their being upon earth. As long as heaven\\r\\nvouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm\\r\\nhereafter, and even when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as\\r\\nhe needs must, and makes the best of it; for God almighty gives men their daily\\r\\nminds day by day. I know all about it, for I was a rich man once, and did much\\r\\nwrong in the stubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and\\r\\nmy brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all things\\r\\nalways, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him without vain\\r\\nglory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see how they are\\r\\nwasting the estate, and doing dishonour to the wife, of one who is certain to\\r\\nreturn some day, and that, too, not long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may\\r\\nheaven send you home quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of\\r\\nhis coming, for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he put the\\r\\ngold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked away serious and bowing\\r\\nhis head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he did not escape destruction, for\\r\\nMinerva had doomed him to fall by the hand of Telemachus. So he took his seat\\r\\nagain at the place from which he had come.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the suitors,\\r\\nthat she might make them still more enamoured of her, and win still further\\r\\nhonour from her son and husband. So she feigned a mocking laugh and said,\\r\\n“Eurynome, I have changed my mind, and have a fancy to show myself to the\\r\\nsuitors although I detest them. I should like also to give my son a hint that\\r\\nhe had better not have anything more to do with them. They speak fairly enough\\r\\nbut they mean mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear child,” answered Eurynome, “all that you have said is true, go and\\r\\ntell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your face. Do not go\\r\\nabout with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is not right that you should\\r\\ngrieve so incessantly; for Telemachus, whom you always prayed that you might\\r\\nlive to see with a beard, is already grown up.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know, Eurynome,” replied Penelope, “that you mean well, but do not try and\\r\\npersuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed me of all my beauty\\r\\non the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell Autonoe and Hippodamia that I\\r\\nwant them. They must be with me when I am in the cloister; I am not going among\\r\\nthe men alone; it would not be proper for me to do so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the old woman[150] went out of the room to bid the\\r\\nmaids go to their mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another\\r\\nmatter, and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her\\r\\ncouch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed grace and\\r\\nbeauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her. She washed her face\\r\\nwith the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears when she goes dancing with the\\r\\nGraces; she made her taller and of a more commanding figure, while as for her\\r\\ncomplexion it was whiter than sawn ivory. When Minerva had done all this she\\r\\nwent away, whereon the maids came in from the women’s room and woke Penelope\\r\\nwith the sound of their talking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,” said she, as she\\r\\npassed her hands over her face, “in spite of all my misery. I wish Diana would\\r\\nlet me die so sweetly now at this very moment, that I might no longer waste in\\r\\ndespair for the loss of my dear husband, who possessed every kind of good\\r\\nquality and was the most distinguished man among the Achaeans.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but attended by\\r\\ntwo of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the\\r\\nbearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her\\r\\nface, and with a staid maid servant on either side of her. As they beheld her\\r\\nthe suitors were so overpowered and became so desperately enamoured of her,\\r\\nthat each one prayed he might win her for his own bed fellow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said she, addressing her son, “I fear you are no longer so\\r\\ndiscreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger you had a\\r\\ngreater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown up, though a\\r\\nstranger to look at you would take you for the son of a well to do father as\\r\\nfar as size and good looks go, your conduct is by no means what it should be.\\r\\nWhat is all this disturbance that has been going on, and how came you to allow\\r\\na stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What would have happened if he\\r\\nhad suffered serious injury while a suppliant in our house? Surely this would\\r\\nhave been very discreditable to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,” replied Telemachus,\\r\\n“I understand all about it and know when things are not as they should be,\\r\\nwhich I could not do when I was younger; I cannot, however, behave with perfect\\r\\npropriety at all times. First one and then another of these wicked people here\\r\\nkeeps driving me out of my mind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all,\\r\\nhowever, this fight between Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the\\r\\nsuitors meant it to do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father\\r\\nJove, Minerva, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers of\\r\\nyours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might all be as limp\\r\\nas Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See how he nods his head\\r\\nlike a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing that he cannot stand on his\\r\\nfeet nor get back to his home, wherever that may be, for he has no strength\\r\\nleft in him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, “Queen Penelope,\\r\\ndaughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could see you at this\\r\\nmoment, you would have still more suitors in your house by tomorrow morning,\\r\\nfor you are the most admirable woman in the whole world both as regards\\r\\npersonal beauty and strength of understanding.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Penelope replied, “Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my beauty\\r\\nwhether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear\\r\\nhusband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs, I should\\r\\nboth be more respected and show a better presence to the world. As it is, I am\\r\\noppressed with care, and with the afflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap\\r\\nupon me. My husband foresaw it all, and when he was leaving home he took my\\r\\nright wrist in his hand—‘Wife,’ he said, ‘we shall not all of us come safe home\\r\\nfrom Troy, for the Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are\\r\\nexcellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a\\r\\nfight sooner than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back\\r\\nto you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do you\\r\\nlook after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at present, and\\r\\neven more so during my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, then\\r\\nmarry whom you will, and leave this your present home.’ This is what he said\\r\\nand now it is all coming true. A night will come when I shall have to yield\\r\\nmyself to a marriage which I detest, for Jove has taken from me all hope of\\r\\nhappiness. This further grief, moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You suitors\\r\\nare not wooing me after the custom of my country. When men are courting a woman\\r\\nwho they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when\\r\\nthey are each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and sheep\\r\\nto feast the friends of the lady, and they make her magnificent presents,\\r\\ninstead of eating up other people’s property without paying for it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying to get\\r\\npresents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words which he knew\\r\\nshe did not mean.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Antinous said, “Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many presents\\r\\nas you please from any one who will give them to you; it is not well to refuse\\r\\na present; but we will not go about our business nor stir from where we are,\\r\\ntill you have married the best man among us whoever he may be.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his servant to\\r\\nbring his present. Antinous’s man returned with a large and lovely dress most\\r\\nexquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully made brooch pins of pure\\r\\ngold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus immediately brought her a magnificent\\r\\nchain of gold and amber beads that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas’s two men\\r\\nreturned with some earrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which\\r\\nglistened most beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a\\r\\nnecklace of the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful\\r\\npresent of some kind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought the\\r\\npresents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and dancing, and\\r\\nstayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it grew dark; they then\\r\\nbrought in three braziers[151] to give light, and piled them up\\r\\nwith chopped firewood very old and dry, and they lit torches from them, which\\r\\nthe maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the queen inside\\r\\nthe house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick wool. I will hold the\\r\\nlight for all these people. They may stay till morning, but shall not beat me,\\r\\nfor I can stand a great deal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho began to\\r\\ngibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but had been brought up\\r\\nby Penelope, who used to give her toys to play with, and looked after her when\\r\\nshe was a child; but in spite of all this she showed no consideration for the\\r\\nsorrows of her mistress, and used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with\\r\\nwhom she was in love.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Poor wretch,” said she, “are you gone clean out of your mind? Go and sleep in\\r\\nsome smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering here. Are you\\r\\nnot ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters—so many of them too? Has\\r\\nthe wine been getting into your head, or do you always babble in this way? You\\r\\nseem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Irus; take care that a\\r\\nbetter man than he does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack you\\r\\nbleeding out of the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Vixen,” replied Ulysses, scowling at her, “I will go and tell Telemachus what\\r\\nyou have been saying, and he will have you torn limb from limb.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body of the\\r\\nhouse. They trembled all over, for they thought he would do as he said. But\\r\\nUlysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding up torches and\\r\\nlooking at the people—brooding the while on things that should surely come to\\r\\npass.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their insolence, for\\r\\nshe wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against them; she therefore set\\r\\nEurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him, which made the others laugh.\\r\\n“Listen to me,” said he, “you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even\\r\\nas I am minded. It is not for nothing that this man has come to the house of\\r\\nUlysses; I believe the light has not been coming from the torches, but from his\\r\\nown head—for his hair is all gone, every bit of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Ulysses he said, “Stranger, will you work as a servant, if I\\r\\nsend you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you build a stone\\r\\nfence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year round, and will find\\r\\nyou in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not you; for you have got into\\r\\nbad ways, and do not want to work; you had rather fill your belly by going\\r\\nround the country begging.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eurymachus,” answered Ulysses, “if you and I were to work one against the\\r\\nother in early summer when the days are at their longest—give me a good scythe,\\r\\nand take another yourself, and let us see which will last the longer or mow the\\r\\nstronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing grass is about. Or if you will\\r\\nplough against me, let us each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of\\r\\ngreat strength and endurance: turn me into a four acre field, and see whether\\r\\nyou or I can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out this\\r\\nday, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my\\r\\ntemples—you would find me foremost in the fray, and would cease your gibes\\r\\nabout my belly. You are insolent and cruel, and think yourself a great man\\r\\nbecause you live in a little world, and that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his\\r\\nown again, the doors of his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when\\r\\nyou try to fly through them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, “You wretch, I\\r\\nwill soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me, and in public too.\\r\\nHas the wine been getting into your head or do you always babble in this way?\\r\\nYou seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Irus.” With this he\\r\\ncaught hold of a footstool, but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of\\r\\nAmphinomus of Dulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his\\r\\nright hand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and\\r\\nhis wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered cloister\\r\\nwere now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying, “I\\r\\nwish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to him, for all the trouble\\r\\nhe gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill\\r\\ncounsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, “Sirs, are you mad? Can you not carry\\r\\nyour meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has possessed you. I do\\r\\nnot wish to drive any of you away, but you have had your suppers, and the\\r\\nsooner you all go home to bed the better.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; but\\r\\nAmphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, “Do not let us take\\r\\noffence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. Neither let us do violence\\r\\nto the stranger nor to any of Ulysses’ servants. Let the cupbearer go round\\r\\nwith the drink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As for\\r\\nthe stranger, let us leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to his house\\r\\nthat he has come.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of Dulichium,\\r\\nservant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water and handed it round\\r\\nto each of them man by man, whereon they made their drink-offerings to the\\r\\nblessed gods: Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each\\r\\none as he was minded, they took their several ways each of them to his own\\r\\nabode.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIX\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR—ULYSSES INTERVIEWS PENELOPE—EURYCLEA\\r\\nWASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO\\r\\nULYSSES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with Minerva’s\\r\\nhelp he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said to Telemachus,\\r\\n“Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take it down inside. Make some\\r\\nexcuse when the suitors ask you why you have removed it. Say that you have\\r\\ntaken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it\\r\\nwas when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add\\r\\nto this more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\\r\\nover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\\r\\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse Euryclea\\r\\nand said, “Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take the armour that\\r\\nmy father left behind him down into the store room. No one looks after it now\\r\\nmy father is gone, and it has got all smirched with soot during my own boyhood.\\r\\nI want to take it down where the smoke cannot reach it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish, child,” answered Euryclea, “that you would take the management of the\\r\\nhouse into your own hands altogether, and look after all the property yourself.\\r\\nBut who is to go with you and light you to the store-room? The maids would have\\r\\ndone so, but you would not let them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The stranger,” said Telemachus, “shall show me a light; when people eat my\\r\\nbread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room. Then\\r\\nUlysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields, and spears\\r\\ninside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her hand that shed a\\r\\nsoft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said, “Father, my eyes behold a\\r\\ngreat marvel: the walls, with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on\\r\\nwhich they rest are all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god\\r\\nhere who has come down from heaven.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush,” answered Ulysses, “hold your peace and ask no questions, for this is\\r\\nthe manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here to talk with\\r\\nyour mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will ask me all sorts of\\r\\nquestions.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner court, to\\r\\nthe room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed till morning, while\\r\\nUlysses was left in the cloister pondering on the means whereby with Minerva’s\\r\\nhelp he might be able to kill the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and they set\\r\\nher a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the fire in her\\r\\naccustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a footstool all in one\\r\\npiece with the seat itself; and it was covered with a thick fleece: on this she\\r\\nnow sat, and the maids came from the women’s room to join her. They set about\\r\\nremoving the tables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away\\r\\nthe bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied\\r\\nthe embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both\\r\\nlight and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said,\\r\\n“Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and\\r\\nspying upon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there,\\r\\nor you shall be driven out with a firebrand.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, “My good woman, why should you be so angry\\r\\nwith me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and\\r\\nbecause I am obliged to go begging about after the manner of tramps and beggars\\r\\ngenerally? I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those\\r\\ndays I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor\\r\\nwhat he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which\\r\\npeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to\\r\\ntake all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that\\r\\npride and place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest\\r\\nyou get out of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home,\\r\\nfor there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead as\\r\\nyou think he is, yet by Apollo’s will he has left a son behind him, Telemachus,\\r\\nwho will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no\\r\\nlonger in his boyhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, “Impudent baggage,”\\r\\nsaid she, “I see how abominably you are behaving, and you shall smart for it.\\r\\nYou knew perfectly well, for I told you myself, that I was going to see the\\r\\nstranger and ask him about my husband, for whose sake I am in such continual\\r\\nsorrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, “Bring a seat with a fleece\\r\\nupon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story, and listens to\\r\\nwhat I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon as\\r\\nUlysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, “Stranger, I shall first ask you\\r\\nwho and whence are you? Tell me of your town and parents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “who on the face of the whole earth can dare to\\r\\nchide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself; you are like\\r\\nsome blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the monarch over a great and\\r\\nvaliant nation: the earth yields its wheat and barley, the trees are loaded\\r\\nwith fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason\\r\\nof his virtues, and his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit\\r\\nhere in your house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know my race\\r\\nand family, or you will recall memories that will yet more increase my sorrow.\\r\\nI am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in another\\r\\nperson’s house, nor is it well to be thus grieving continually. I shall have\\r\\none of the servants or even yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes\\r\\nswim with tears because I am heavy with wine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope answered, “Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty, whether of\\r\\nface or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear husband with\\r\\nthem. If he were to return and look after my affairs I should be both more\\r\\nrespected and should show a better presence to the world. As it is, I am\\r\\noppressed with care, and with the afflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap\\r\\nupon me. The chiefs from all our islands—Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as\\r\\nalso from Ithaca itself, are wooing me against my will and are wasting my\\r\\nestate. I can therefore show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to\\r\\npeople who say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time\\r\\nbroken-hearted about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have\\r\\nto invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven put it\\r\\nin my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin working\\r\\nupon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them, ‘Sweethearts,\\r\\nUlysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately;\\r\\nwait—for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded—till I have\\r\\nfinished making a pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when\\r\\ndeath shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if\\r\\nhe is laid out without a pall.’ This was what I said, and they assented;\\r\\nwhereon I used to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I\\r\\nwould unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for\\r\\nthree years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was now in\\r\\nmy fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished,\\r\\nthose good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who broke\\r\\nin upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was forced to\\r\\nfinish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see how I can find any\\r\\nfurther shift for getting out of this marriage. My parents are putting great\\r\\npressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon\\r\\nhis estate, for he is now old enough to understand all about it and is\\r\\nperfectly able to look after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with\\r\\nan excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are\\r\\nand where you come from—for you must have had father and mother of some sort;\\r\\nyou cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in asking me\\r\\nabout my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me: people must expect\\r\\nto be pained when they have been exiles as long as I have, and suffered as much\\r\\namong as many peoples. Nevertheless, as regards your question I will tell you\\r\\nall you ask. There is a fair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it\\r\\nis thickly peopled and there are ninety cities in it: the people speak many\\r\\ndifferent languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave\\r\\nEteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great\\r\\ntown there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had a conference\\r\\nwith Jove himself.[152] Minos was father to Deucalion,\\r\\nwhose son I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus\\r\\nsailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my brother,\\r\\nhowever, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two; hence it was in\\r\\nCrete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, for the winds took him\\r\\nthere as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him out of his course from cape\\r\\nMalea and leaving him in Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours\\r\\nare difficult to enter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds that\\r\\nwere then raging. As soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for\\r\\nIdomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already\\r\\nset sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own\\r\\nhouse and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of\\r\\neverything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the\\r\\npublic store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to\\r\\ntheir heart’s content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale\\r\\nblowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one’s feet on land.\\r\\nI suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day\\r\\nthe wind dropped, and they got away.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept as she\\r\\nlistened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the mountain tops\\r\\nwhen the winds from South East and West have breathed upon it and thawed it\\r\\ntill the rivers run bank full with water, even so did her cheeks overflow with\\r\\ntears for the husband who was all the time sitting by her side. Ulysses felt\\r\\nfor her and was sorry for her, but he kept his eyes as hard as horn or iron\\r\\nwithout letting them so much as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears.\\r\\nThen, when she had relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and\\r\\nsaid: “Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you\\r\\nreally did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then,\\r\\nhow he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so also with his\\r\\ncompanions.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “it is such a long time ago that I can hardly say.\\r\\nTwenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went elsewhither; but\\r\\nI will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of purple\\r\\nwool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for\\r\\nthe pin. On the face of this there was a device that shewed a dog holding a\\r\\nspotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the\\r\\nground. Every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in\\r\\ngold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was\\r\\nstruggling convulsively to escape.[153] As for the shirt that he wore next\\r\\nhis skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and\\r\\nglistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld it.\\r\\nFurthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether\\r\\nUlysses wore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companions\\r\\nhad given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose\\r\\nhouse he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of many\\r\\nfriends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of\\r\\nbronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down\\r\\nto his feet, and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had\\r\\na servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was\\r\\nlike; his shoulders were hunched,[154] he was dark, and he had thick curly\\r\\nhair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater familiarity\\r\\nthan he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded with himself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable proofs that\\r\\nUlysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief in tears she said\\r\\nto him, “Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall\\r\\nbe honoured and made welcome in my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes\\r\\nyou speak of. I took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and\\r\\nI gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never\\r\\nwelcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that\\r\\ndetested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure yourself\\r\\nfurther by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly blame you\\r\\nfor doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne him children, would\\r\\nnaturally be grieved at losing him, even though he were a worse man than\\r\\nUlysses, who they say was like a god. Still, cease your tears and listen to\\r\\nwhat I can tell you. I will hide nothing from you, and can say with perfect\\r\\ntruth that I have lately heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home;\\r\\nhe is among the Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that\\r\\nhe has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were\\r\\nlost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god were\\r\\nangry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god’s cattle, and they\\r\\nwere all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the keel of the ship and was\\r\\ndrifted on to the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals,\\r\\nand who treated him as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and\\r\\nwishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\\r\\nlong ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth;\\r\\nfor there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one can compare\\r\\nwith him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all this, and he swore to\\r\\nme—making drink-offerings in his house as he did so—that the ship was by the\\r\\nwater side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own country. He\\r\\nsent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the\\r\\nwheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses\\r\\nhad got together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep\\r\\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona\\r\\nthat he might learn Jove’s mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after\\r\\nso long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret. So you may\\r\\nknow he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at hand and cannot remain\\r\\naway from home much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath,\\r\\nand call Jove who is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also\\r\\nthat hearth of Ulysses to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall\\r\\nsurely come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end\\r\\nof this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true you shall have\\r\\nsuch gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate\\r\\nyou; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses will not return, neither will\\r\\nyou get your escort hence, for so surely as that Ulysses ever was, there are\\r\\nnow no longer any such masters in the house as he was, to receive honourable\\r\\nstrangers or to further them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his\\r\\nfeet for him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may\\r\\nbe warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him\\r\\nagain, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It\\r\\nshall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him;\\r\\nlike it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how, sir, shall\\r\\nyou be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex both in\\r\\ngoodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid\\r\\nand ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal\\r\\nhardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak\\r\\ncontemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals\\r\\nrighteously, the people tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call\\r\\nhim blessed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that\\r\\nI left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will lie as I have lain\\r\\non many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night have I passed in any\\r\\nrough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor, again, do I like having my\\r\\nfeet washed; I shall not let any of the young hussies about your house touch my\\r\\nfeet; but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as\\r\\nmuch trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Penelope said, “My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet came to my\\r\\nhouse there never was one who spoke in all things with such admirable propriety\\r\\nas you do. There happens to be in the house a most respectable old woman—the\\r\\nsame who received my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was born, and\\r\\nnursed him in infancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.”\\r\\n“Come here,” said she, “Euryclea, and wash your master’s age-mate; I suppose\\r\\nUlysses’ hands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages\\r\\nall of us dreadfully fast.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began to weep\\r\\nand made lamentation saying, “My dear child, I cannot think whatever I am to do\\r\\nwith you. I am certain no one was ever more god-fearing than yourself, and yet\\r\\nJove hates you. No one in the whole world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor\\r\\ngave him finer hecatombs when you prayed you might come to a green old age\\r\\nyourself and see your son grow up to take after you: yet see how he has\\r\\nprevented you alone from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt\\r\\nthe women in some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as\\r\\nall these sluts here have been gibing at you. I do not wonder at your not\\r\\nchoosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have insulted you;\\r\\nI will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope has said that I am to\\r\\ndo so; I will wash them both for Penelope’s sake and for your own, for you have\\r\\nraised the most lively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this\\r\\nmoreover, which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress\\r\\ncome here before now, but I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was\\r\\nso like Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Those who have seen us both,” answered Ulysses, “have always said we were\\r\\nwonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his feet,\\r\\nand poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath was warm\\r\\nenough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away from the light,\\r\\nfor it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold of his leg she would\\r\\nrecognise a certain scar which it bore, whereon the whole truth would come out.\\r\\nAnd indeed as soon as she began washing her master, she at once knew the scar\\r\\nas one that had been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on Mt.\\r\\nParnassus with his excellent grandfather Autolycus—who was the most\\r\\naccomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world—and with the sons of\\r\\nAutolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, for he used to burn\\r\\nthe thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he took pleasure in his\\r\\ncompanionship. It happened once that Autolycus had gone to Ithaca and had found\\r\\nthe child of his daughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set\\r\\nthe infant upon his knees and said, “Autolycus, you must find a name for your\\r\\ngrandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Son-in-law and daughter,” replied Autolycus, “call the child thus: I am highly\\r\\ndispleased with a large number of people in one place and another, both men and\\r\\nwomen; so name the child ‘Ulysses,’ or the child of anger. When he grows up and\\r\\ncomes to visit his mother’s family on Mt. Parnassus, where my possessions lie,\\r\\nI will make him a present and will send him on his way rejoicing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from Autolycus, who\\r\\nwith his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome. His grandmother\\r\\nAmphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both his beautiful\\r\\neyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as he\\r\\ntold them. They brought in a five year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and\\r\\ndivided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up into smaller pieces\\r\\nand spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round.\\r\\nThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and\\r\\nevery man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set\\r\\nand it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of Autolycus\\r\\nwent out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too. They climbed the\\r\\nwooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy upland valleys; but as\\r\\nthe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh-risen from the slow still\\r\\ncurrents of Oceanus, they came to a mountain dell. The dogs were in front\\r\\nsearching for the tracks of the beast they were chasing, and after them came\\r\\nthe sons of Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he\\r\\nhad a long spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick\\r\\nbrushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it, nor could\\r\\nthe sun’s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick with fallen\\r\\nleaves. The boar heard the noise of the men’s feet, and the hounds baying on\\r\\nevery side as the huntsmen came up to him, so he rushed from his lair, raised\\r\\nthe bristles on his neck, and stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes.\\r\\nUlysses was the first to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute,\\r\\nbut the boar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above\\r\\nthe knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for\\r\\nthe boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear\\r\\nwent right through him, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life\\r\\nwent out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcass of\\r\\nthe boar, and bound Ulysses’ wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the\\r\\nbleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and his sons\\r\\nhad thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent\\r\\nhim back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his father and\\r\\nmother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about it, and how he had\\r\\nhurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when\\r\\nhe was out hunting with Autolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well hold of\\r\\nit, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg fell into the bath,\\r\\nwhich rang out and was overturned, so that all the water was spilt on the\\r\\nground; Euryclea’s eyes between her joy and her grief filled with tears, and\\r\\nshe could not speak, but she caught Ulysses by the beard and said, “My dear\\r\\nchild, I am sure you must be Ulysses himself, only I did not know you till I\\r\\nhad actually touched and handled you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her that\\r\\nher dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to look in that\\r\\ndirection and observe what was going on, for Minerva had diverted her\\r\\nattention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with his right hand and\\r\\nwith his left drew her close to him, and said, “Nurse, do you wish to be the\\r\\nruin of me, you who nursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years\\r\\nof wandering I am at last come to my own home again? Since it has been borne in\\r\\nupon you by heaven to recognise me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word\\r\\nabout it to any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you—and it shall\\r\\nsurely be—that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will\\r\\nnot spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other women.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My child,” answered Euryclea, “what are you talking about? You know very well\\r\\nthat nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my tongue like a stone or\\r\\na piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay my saying to your heart, when\\r\\nheaven has delivered the suitors into your hand, I will give you a list of the\\r\\nwomen in the house who have been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am well\\r\\nable to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your tongue and\\r\\nleave everything to heaven.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water, for the\\r\\nfirst had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and anointed him with\\r\\noil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself, and hid the scar\\r\\nunder his rags. Then Penelope began talking to him and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter. It is\\r\\nindeed nearly bed time—for those, at least, who can sleep in spite of sorrow.\\r\\nAs for myself, heaven has given me a life of such unmeasurable woe, that even\\r\\nby day when I am attending to my duties and looking after the servants, I am\\r\\nstill weeping and lamenting during the whole time; then, when night comes, and\\r\\nwe all of us go to bed, I lie awake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey to\\r\\nthe most incessant and cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of\\r\\nPandareus, sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and\\r\\nwith many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own\\r\\nchild Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in its\\r\\nuncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard my\\r\\nsubstance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard to public\\r\\nopinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me\\r\\nto go with the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me such\\r\\nmagnificent presents. As long as my son was still young, and unable to\\r\\nunderstand, he would not hear of my leaving my husband’s house, but now that he\\r\\nis full grown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in which\\r\\nthe suitors are eating up his property. Listen, then, to a dream that I have\\r\\nhad and interpret it for me if you can. I have twenty geese about the house\\r\\nthat eat mash out of a trough,[155] and of which I am exceedingly fond.\\r\\nI dreamed that a great eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his\\r\\ncurved beak into the neck of each of them till he had killed them all.\\r\\nPresently he soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;\\r\\nwhereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously\\r\\nwas I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back again,\\r\\nand perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice, and told me\\r\\nto leave off crying. ‘Be of good courage,’ he said, ‘daughter of Icarius; this\\r\\nis no dream, but a vision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. The\\r\\ngeese are the suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who\\r\\nam come back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ On\\r\\nthis I woke, and when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their\\r\\nmash as usual.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This dream, Madam,” replied Ulysses, “can admit but of one interpretation, for\\r\\nhad not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The death of the\\r\\nsuitors is portended, and not one single one of them will escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Penelope answered, “Stranger, dreams are very curious and unaccountable\\r\\nthings, and they do not by any means invariably come true. There are two gates\\r\\nthrough which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one is of horn, and the\\r\\nother ivory. Those that come through the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those\\r\\nfrom the gate of horn mean something to those that see them. I do not think,\\r\\nhowever, that my own dream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son\\r\\nshould be most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say—and lay\\r\\nmy saying to your heart—the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened day that\\r\\nis to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about to hold a tournament\\r\\nof axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the court, one in front of\\r\\nthe other, like the stays upon which a ship is built; he would then go back\\r\\nfrom them and shoot an arrow through the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors\\r\\ntry to do the same thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily,\\r\\nand send his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit\\r\\nthis house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even\\r\\nso, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your\\r\\ntournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow, handle it\\r\\nhow they will, and send their arrows through the iron.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Penelope said, “As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk to me, I\\r\\ncan have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do permanently without\\r\\nsleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth a time for all things. I\\r\\nwill therefore go upstairs and recline upon that couch which I have never\\r\\nceased to flood with my tears from the day Ulysses set out for the city with a\\r\\nhateful name.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her maidens,\\r\\nand when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep\\r\\nover her eyelids.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XX\\n\\r\\nULYSSES CANNOT SLEEP—PENELOPE’S PRAYER TO DIANA—THE TWO SIGNS FROM\\r\\nHEAVEN—EUMAEUS AND PHILOETIUS ARRIVE—THE SUITORS DINE—CTESIPPUS THROWS AN OX’S\\r\\nFOOT AT ULYSSES—THEOCLYMENUS FORETELLS DISASTER AND LEAVES THE HOUSE.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock’s hide, on the top of\\r\\nwhich he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten, and Eurynome[156] threw a cloak\\r\\nover him after he had laid himself down. There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully\\r\\nbrooding upon the way in which he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the\\r\\nwomen who had been in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the\\r\\nhouse giggling and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very angry, and\\r\\nhe doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of them then and there,\\r\\nor to let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors. His heart growled\\r\\nwithin him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and shows her teeth when she\\r\\nsees a stranger, so did his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were\\r\\nbeing done: but he beat his breast and said, “Heart, be still, you had worse\\r\\nthan this to bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave\\r\\ncompanions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of\\r\\nthe cave, though you made sure of being killed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he tossed\\r\\nabout as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire,\\r\\ndoing it first on one side and then on the other, that he may get it cooked as\\r\\nsoon as possible, even so did he turn himself about from side to side, thinking\\r\\nall the time how, single handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large\\r\\na body of men as the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from\\r\\nheaven in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, “My poor\\r\\nunhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is\\r\\nsafe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father\\r\\nmay be proud of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Goddess,” answered Ulysses, “all that you have said is true, but I am in some\\r\\ndoubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors single handed,\\r\\nseeing what a number of them there always are. And there is this further\\r\\ndifficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing that with Jove’s and\\r\\nyour assistance I succeed in killing them, I must ask you to consider where I\\r\\nam to escape to from their avengers when it is all over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For shame,” replied Minerva, “why, any one else would trust a worse ally than\\r\\nmyself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise than I am. Am I\\r\\nnot a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout in all your troubles? I\\r\\ntell you plainly that even though there were fifty bands of men surrounding us\\r\\nand eager to kill us, you should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive\\r\\nthem away with you. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all\\r\\nnight, and you shall be out of your troubles before long.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to Olympus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that eased the\\r\\nburden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting up in her bed\\r\\nbegan to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she prayed to Diana\\r\\nsaying, “Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an arrow into my heart\\r\\nand slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of\\r\\ndarkness till it drop me into the mouths of over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the\\r\\ndaughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and\\r\\nmother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took\\r\\ncare of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them\\r\\nto excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an\\r\\nimposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment;\\r\\nbut one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them\\r\\nmarried (for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to\\r\\nevery one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to\\r\\nthe dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide\\r\\nme from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go\\r\\neven beneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only,\\r\\nand without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no\\r\\nmatter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as\\r\\nthey can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget\\r\\ngood and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very\\r\\nnight methought there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was\\r\\nwhen he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no\\r\\ndream, but the very truth itself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and it\\r\\npuzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by his side.\\r\\nThen he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain, and set\\r\\nthem on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock’s hide out into the\\r\\nopen. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed, saying “Father Jove, since\\r\\nyou have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the\\r\\nafflictions you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one\\r\\nor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me have another\\r\\nsign of some kind from outside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up among\\r\\nthe clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when he heard\\r\\nit. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from hard by in the mill\\r\\nroom lifted up her voice and gave him another sign. There were twelve\\r\\nmiller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley which are the\\r\\nstaff of life. The others had ground their task and had gone to take their\\r\\nrest, but this one had not yet finished, for she was not so strong as they\\r\\nwere, and when she heard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to\\r\\nher master. “Father Jove,” said she, “you, who rule over heaven and earth, you\\r\\nhave thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this\\r\\nmeans something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor servant\\r\\nwho calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors dine in\\r\\nthe house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour of grinding meal for\\r\\nthem, and I hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman’s speech,\\r\\nand by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge himself on the\\r\\nsuitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\\r\\nTelemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about his\\r\\nshoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a doughty spear\\r\\nwith a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the cloister\\r\\nand said to Euryclea, “Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable both as\\r\\nregards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself?—for my mother,\\r\\ngood woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate\\r\\npeople, and of neglecting others who are in reality much better men.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not find fault child,” said Euryclea, “when there is no one to find fault\\r\\nwith. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked: your mother did\\r\\nask him if he would take any more bread and he said he would not. When he\\r\\nwanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one for him, but he said he\\r\\nwas such a wretched outcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under\\r\\nblankets; he insisted on having an undressed bullock’s hide and some sheepskins\\r\\nput for him in the cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.”[157]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans were\\r\\nmeeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not alone, for\\r\\nhis two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids and said, “Come, wake\\r\\nup; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the\\r\\ndust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a\\r\\nwet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and go for water from the\\r\\nfountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,\\r\\nfor it is a feast day.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them went to\\r\\nthe fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to work about the\\r\\nhouse. The men who were in attendance on the suitors also came up and began\\r\\nchopping firewood. By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the\\r\\nswineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out. These he\\r\\nlet feed about the premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,\\r\\n“Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as insolent\\r\\nas ever?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May heaven,” answered Ulysses, “requite to them the wickedness with which they\\r\\ndeal high-handedly in another man’s house without any sense of shame.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for he too\\r\\nwas bringing in his best goats for the suitors’ dinner; and he had two\\r\\nshepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then\\r\\nMelanthius began gibing at Ulysses. “Are you still here, stranger,” said he,\\r\\n“to pester people by begging about the house? Why can you not go elsewhere? You\\r\\nand I shall not come to an understanding before we have given each other a\\r\\ntaste of our fists. You beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts\\r\\nelsewhere among the Achaeans, as well as here?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third man,\\r\\nPhiloetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats.\\r\\nThese were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people over when\\r\\nany one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer and his goats secure under\\r\\nthe gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd. “Who, Swineherd,” said he,\\r\\n“is this stranger that is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his\\r\\nfamily? Where does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\\r\\ngreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will—even to kings if it so\\r\\npleases them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand; “Good\\r\\nday to you, father stranger,” said he, “you seem to be very poorly off now, but\\r\\nI hope you will have better times by and by. Father Jove, of all gods you are\\r\\nthe most malicious. We are your own children, yet you show us no mercy in all\\r\\nour misery and afflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my\\r\\neyes filled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about\\r\\nin just such rags as this man’s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If\\r\\nhe is already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,\\r\\nwho made me his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians, and\\r\\nnow his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them than I\\r\\nhave, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep\\r\\nbringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed to his son though he is in\\r\\nthe house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide\\r\\nUlysses’ property among them because he has been away so long. I have often\\r\\nthought—only it would not be right while his son is living—of going off with\\r\\nthe cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still harder to\\r\\nstay here and be ill-treated about other people’s herds. My position is\\r\\nintolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under the\\r\\nprotection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet\\r\\nreturn, and send all these suitors flying out of the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stockman,” answered Ulysses, “you seem to be a very well-disposed person, and\\r\\nI can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell you, and will\\r\\nconfirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of all gods, and by that\\r\\nhearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses shall return before you leave\\r\\nthis place, and if you are so minded you shall see him killing the suitors who\\r\\nare now masters here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If Jove were to bring this to pass,” replied the stockman, “you should see how\\r\\nI would do my very utmost to help him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to murder\\r\\nTelemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand—an eagle with a dove\\r\\nin its talons. On this Amphinomus said, “My friends, this plot of ours to\\r\\nmurder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to dinner instead.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches\\r\\nand seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the\\r\\ninward meats were cooked they served them round. They mixed the wine in the\\r\\nmixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed\\r\\nround the bread in the bread baskets, and Melanthius poured them out their\\r\\nwine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that was\\r\\npaved with stone;[158] he gave him a shabby looking seat\\r\\nat a little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\\r\\nto him, with his wine in a gold cup. “Sit there,” said he, “and drink your wine\\r\\namong the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows of the\\r\\nsuitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses, and has passed\\r\\nfrom him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to\\r\\nyourselves, or there will be mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; then\\r\\nAntinous said, “We do not like such language but we will put up with it, for\\r\\nTelemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had let us we should have\\r\\nput a stop to his brave talk ere now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the heralds were\\r\\nbringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the Achaeans gathered under\\r\\nthe shady grove of Apollo.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man his\\r\\nportion, and feasted to their heart’s content; those who waited at table gave\\r\\nUlysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemachus had told\\r\\nthem to do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence, for\\r\\nshe wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them. Now there happened\\r\\nto be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus, and who came from\\r\\nSame. This man, confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of\\r\\nUlysses, and said to the suitors, “Hear what I have to say. The stranger has\\r\\nalready had as large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not\\r\\nright nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I\\r\\nwill, however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have something\\r\\nto give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses’ servants.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer’s foot from the meat-basket in which it lay,\\r\\nand threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little aside, and\\r\\navoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion[159] as he did so, and it hit the wall,\\r\\nnot him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to Ctesippus, “It is a good thing\\r\\nfor you,” said he, “that the stranger turned his head so that you missed him.\\r\\nIf you had hit him I should have run you through with my spear, and your father\\r\\nwould have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this\\r\\nhouse. So let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am\\r\\ngrown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,\\r\\ninstead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen you\\r\\nkilling my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have put up with\\r\\nthis, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further violence. Still,\\r\\nif you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather die than see such\\r\\ndisgraceful scenes day after day—guests insulted, and men dragging the women\\r\\nservants about the house in an unseemly way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said, “No one\\r\\nshould take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for it is quite\\r\\nreasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger, or any one else of\\r\\nthe servants who are about the house; I would say, however, a friendly word to\\r\\nTelemachus and his mother, which I trust may commend itself to both. ‘As long,’\\r\\nI would say, ‘as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come\\r\\nhome, no one could complain of your waiting and suffering[160] the suitors to\\r\\nbe in your house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but\\r\\nit is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this\\r\\nquietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man, and the one\\r\\nwho makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able to\\r\\nmanage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink in peace, while your mother\\r\\nwill look after some other man’s house, not yours.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Telemachus answered, “By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my\\r\\nunhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is wandering in\\r\\nsome distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother’s marriage; on\\r\\nthe contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will give her\\r\\nnumberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she\\r\\nshall leave the house against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set their wits\\r\\nwandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter. Their meat became\\r\\nsmeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts were heavy\\r\\nwith forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and said, “Unhappy men, what is it that\\r\\nails you? There is a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your\\r\\ncheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and\\r\\nroof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are\\r\\nfull of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out of\\r\\nheaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus then said,\\r\\n“This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses. Servants, turn him\\r\\nout into the streets, since he finds it so dark here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Theoclymenus said, “Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me. I have\\r\\neyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an understanding\\r\\nmind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I see mischief\\r\\noverhanging you, from which not one of you men who are insulting people and\\r\\nplotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be able to escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him welcome,\\r\\nbut the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking Telemachus by\\r\\nlaughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to him, “Telemachus, you\\r\\nare not happy in your guests; first you have this importunate tramp, who comes\\r\\nbegging bread and wine and has no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is\\r\\nperfectly useless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as\\r\\na prophet. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better to put them on board\\r\\nship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father, expecting\\r\\nevery moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat placed\\r\\nfor her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear what every one\\r\\nwas saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid much merriment; it had\\r\\nbeen both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed many victims; but the\\r\\nsupper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the\\r\\nmeal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them—for they had\\r\\nbrought their doom upon themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXI\\n\\r\\nTHE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS AND\\r\\nPHILOETIUS\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva now put it in Penelope’s mind to make the suitors try their skill with\\r\\nthe bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves, as a means of\\r\\nbringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and got the store-room key,\\r\\nwhich was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her\\r\\nmaidens into the store-room at the end of the house, where her husband’s\\r\\ntreasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his\\r\\nbow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend\\r\\nwhom he had met in Lacedaemon—Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with\\r\\none another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\\r\\norder to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\\r\\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away\\r\\nwith them and with their shepherds. In quest of these Ulysses took a long\\r\\njourney while still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent\\r\\nhim on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get\\r\\nback twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running\\r\\nwith them. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to\\r\\nthe house of Jove’s son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of\\r\\nvalour, Hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he\\r\\nfeared not heaven’s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set\\r\\nbefore Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares\\r\\nhimself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the\\r\\nbow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death had\\r\\nbeen left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear,\\r\\nand this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although they never visited at\\r\\none another’s houses, for Jove’s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do\\r\\nso. This bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by\\r\\nUlysses when he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home,\\r\\nbut had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the carpenter\\r\\nhad planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite\\r\\nstraight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the doors. She loosed\\r\\nthe strap from the handle of the door, put in the key, and drove it straight\\r\\nhome to shoot back the bolts that held the doors;[161] these flew open with a noise like a\\r\\nbull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform,\\r\\nwhere the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along\\r\\nwith fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow case\\r\\nfrom the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping\\r\\nbitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved\\r\\nher, she went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the\\r\\nquiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came\\r\\nher maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her\\r\\nhusband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of\\r\\nthe bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before\\r\\nher face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house\\r\\nbecause its owner has been long absent, and without other pretext than that you\\r\\nwant to marry me; this, then, being the prize that you are contending for, I\\r\\nwill bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it\\r\\nmost easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I\\r\\nfollow and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in\\r\\nwealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the\\r\\nsuitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by,\\r\\nthe stockman wept also when he saw his master’s bow, but Antinous scolded them.\\r\\n“You country louts,” said he, “silly simpletons; why should you add to the\\r\\nsorrows of your mistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in\\r\\nthe loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence,\\r\\nor go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors\\r\\nshall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light\\r\\nmatter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is\\r\\nsuch another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I was\\r\\nthen only a child.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string\\r\\nthe bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that\\r\\nshould taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring\\r\\nin his own house—egging the others on to do so also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus spoke. “Great heavens!” he exclaimed, “Jove must have robbed me\\r\\nof my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this\\r\\nhouse and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as though there\\r\\nwere nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let\\r\\nit go forward. It is for a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos,\\r\\nor Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I\\r\\ndo; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no\\r\\nexcuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too\\r\\nwill make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I\\r\\nshall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win\\r\\nthe prizes which my father won before me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took\\r\\nhis sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove\\r\\nwhich he had dug for them, and had made straight by line.[162] Then he\\r\\nstamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw\\r\\nhim set them up so orderly, though he had never seen anything of the kind\\r\\nbefore. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice\\r\\ndid he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he\\r\\nhad to leave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the\\r\\niron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not\\r\\nUlysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young,\\r\\nand have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if\\r\\nany one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger than I, make trial\\r\\nof the bow and get this contest settled.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led into\\r\\nthe house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then he sat down\\r\\non the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place at\\r\\nwhich the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He was\\r\\nsacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the mixing-bowl.\\r\\n[163] He was the\\r\\nonly man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant with the others. He was\\r\\nnow the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make\\r\\nhis trial, but he could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused\\r\\nto hard work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, “My\\r\\nfriends, I cannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take the life\\r\\nand soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live\\r\\nafter having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has\\r\\nbrought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that\\r\\nhe may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo\\r\\nand make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever\\r\\nmakes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,[164] with the arrow\\r\\nstanding against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat again on the seat\\r\\nfrom which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and intolerable;\\r\\nit makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow take the life of many\\r\\na chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself? True, you were\\r\\nnot born to be an archer, but there are others who will soon string it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, “Look sharp, light a fire in the\\r\\ncourt, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also a large\\r\\nball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the bow and grease\\r\\nit—we will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside it. He\\r\\nalso brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the house, and the\\r\\nsuitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them\\r\\nnearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless there still remained Antinous\\r\\nand Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders among the suitors and much the\\r\\nforemost among them all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and Ulysses\\r\\nfollowed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer yard, Ulysses\\r\\nsaid to them quietly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in doubt\\r\\nwhether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of men would you\\r\\nbe to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden?\\r\\nSay which you are disposed to do—to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” answered the stockman, “would indeed that you might so ordain\\r\\nit. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see with what might\\r\\nand main I would fight for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return; when,\\r\\ntherefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses said, “It is I,\\r\\nUlysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last, in the twentieth year,\\r\\nI am come back to my own country. I find that you two alone of all my servants\\r\\nare glad that I should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying\\r\\nfor my return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be.\\r\\nIf heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both\\r\\nof you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me\\r\\nas though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give you\\r\\nconvincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is the scar\\r\\nfrom the boar’s tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on Mt. Parnassus\\r\\nwith the sons of Autolycus.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they had\\r\\nexamined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw their arms\\r\\nround him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses kissed their hands\\r\\nand faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if\\r\\nUlysses had not checked them and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and tell\\r\\nthose who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both together; I\\r\\nwill go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this moreover be the token\\r\\nbetween us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent me from getting hold of\\r\\nthe bow and quiver; do you, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you\\r\\nare carrying it about, and tell the women to close the doors of their\\r\\napartment. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the\\r\\nhouse, they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at\\r\\ntheir work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer\\r\\ncourt, and to bind them securely at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat that he\\r\\nhad left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming it by\\r\\nthe fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly grieved. He\\r\\nheaved a deep sigh and said, “I grieve for myself and for us all; I grieve that\\r\\nI shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about\\r\\nthis, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel\\r\\nmost is the fact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot\\r\\nstring his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It shall not be so, Eurymachus,” said Antinous, “and you know it yourself.\\r\\nToday is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can string a bow on\\r\\nsuch a day as this? Put it on one side—as for the axes they can stay where they\\r\\nare, for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away: let the\\r\\ncupbearer go round with his cups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop\\r\\nthis matter of the bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats\\r\\ntomorrow—the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty\\r\\narcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over the\\r\\nhands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water\\r\\nand handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. Then, when they\\r\\nhad made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he desired, Ulysses\\r\\ncraftily said:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded.\\r\\nI appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who has just spoken\\r\\nwith so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and leave the matter to the\\r\\ngods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will. For the\\r\\nmoment, however, give me the bow that I may prove the power of my hands among\\r\\nyou all, and see whether I still have as much strength as I used to have, or\\r\\nwhether travel and neglect have made an end of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,\\r\\nAntinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, “Wretched creature, you have\\r\\nnot so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to think yourself\\r\\nlucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, without having any\\r\\nsmaller portion served you than we others have had, and in being allowed to\\r\\nhear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear\\r\\nwhat we say among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as\\r\\nit does with all those who drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the\\r\\nCentaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When\\r\\nthe wine had got into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house\\r\\nof Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed\\r\\nat him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him through the\\r\\ndoorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his\\r\\ncrime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between\\r\\nmankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own\\r\\ndrunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if\\r\\nyou string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at\\r\\nonce ship you off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you\\r\\nwill never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a\\r\\nquarrel with men younger than yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope then spoke to him. “Antinous,” said she, “it is not right that you\\r\\nshould ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house. If the\\r\\nstranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of Ulysses, can\\r\\nyou suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife? Even the\\r\\nman himself can have no such idea in his mind: none of you need let that\\r\\ndisturb his feasting; it would be out of all reason.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Queen Penelope,” answered Eurymachus, “we do not suppose that this man will\\r\\ntake you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest some of the\\r\\nbaser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping about and say,\\r\\n‘These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the wife of a brave\\r\\nman whose bow not one of them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who\\r\\ncame to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.’ This\\r\\nis what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eurymachus,” Penelope answered, “people who persist in eating up the estate of\\r\\na great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect others to think\\r\\nwell of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will? This\\r\\nstranger is strong and well-built, he says moreover that he is of noble birth.\\r\\nGive him the bow, and let us see whether he can string it or no. I say—and it\\r\\nshall surely be—that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will\\r\\ngive him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and\\r\\nrobbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent\\r\\nsafely wherever he wants to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus said, “Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in the\\r\\nislands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one have the\\r\\nbow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the other, not even\\r\\nthough I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright, and let him\\r\\ntake it away with him. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\r\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This\\r\\nbow is a man’s matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master\\r\\nhere.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in her heart.\\r\\nThen going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear\\r\\nhusband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but the\\r\\nsuitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of them said,\\r\\n“You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If\\r\\nApollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get\\r\\nyou into some quiet little place, and worry you to death.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down\\r\\nthen and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other side of the\\r\\ncloisters, and threatened him saying, “Father Eumaeus, bring the bow on in\\r\\nspite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back to the\\r\\ncountry, for I am the better man of the two. I wish I was as much stronger than\\r\\nall the other suitors in the house as I am than you, I would soon send some of\\r\\nthem off sick and sorry, for they mean mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them in a\\r\\nbetter humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on and placed it in\\r\\nthe hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called Euryclea apart and said\\r\\nto her, “Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to close the doors of the women’s\\r\\napartments. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the\\r\\nhouse, they are not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are\\r\\nat their work.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women’s apartments.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer\\r\\ncourt. There was a ship’s cable of byblus fibre lying in the gatehouse, so he\\r\\nmade the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that he\\r\\nhad left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands,\\r\\nand was turning it every way about, and proving it all over to see whether the\\r\\nworms had been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then would one\\r\\nturn towards his neighbour saying, “This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either\\r\\nhe has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\\r\\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother said, “I hope he may be no more successful in other things than he is\\r\\nlikely to be in stringing this bow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as\\r\\neasily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted\\r\\ngut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string,\\r\\nand it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow. The\\r\\nsuitors were dismayed, and turned colour as they heard it; at that moment,\\r\\nmoreover, Jove thundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as\\r\\nhe heard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table[165]—for those which the Achaeans were\\r\\nso shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver—he laid it on the\\r\\ncentre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string toward\\r\\nhim, still seated on his seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow\\r\\npierced every one of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till\\r\\nit had gone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to\\r\\nTelemachus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I aimed at,\\r\\nand I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and not as the\\r\\nsuitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for the Achaeans to\\r\\nprepare supper while there is still daylight, and then otherwise to disport\\r\\nthemselves with song and dance which are the crowning ornaments of a banquet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on his\\r\\nsword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father’s seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXII\\n\\r\\nTHE KILLING OF THE SUITORS—THE MAIDS WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES ARE MADE\\r\\nTO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement with his\\r\\nbow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground at his\\r\\nfeet and said, “The mighty contest is at an end. I will now see whether Apollo\\r\\nwill vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take up a\\r\\ntwo-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands. He had\\r\\nno thought of death—who amongst all the revellers would think that one man,\\r\\nhowever brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him? The arrow struck\\r\\nAntinous in the throat, and the point went clean through his neck, so that he\\r\\nfell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood\\r\\ngushed from his nostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on\\r\\nit, so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to\\r\\nthe ground.[166]\\r\\nThe suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit; they\\r\\nsprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked everywhere\\r\\ntowards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked\\r\\nUlysses very angrily. “Stranger,” said they, “you shall pay for shooting people\\r\\nin this way: you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you\\r\\nhave slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you\\r\\nfor having killed him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake, and\\r\\ndid not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every one of them. But\\r\\nUlysses glared at them and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have wasted my\\r\\nsubstance,[167]\\r\\nhave forced my women servants to lie with you, and have wooed my wife while I\\r\\nwas still living. You have feared neither God nor man, and now you shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round about to see\\r\\nwhither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you are Ulysses,” said he, “then what you have said is just. We have done\\r\\nmuch wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who was the head and\\r\\nfront of the offending lies low already. It was all his doing. It was not that\\r\\nhe wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much care about that; what he wanted\\r\\nwas something quite different, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted\\r\\nto kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met\\r\\nthe death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make\\r\\neverything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten\\r\\nand drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will\\r\\nkeep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have\\r\\ndone this no one can complain of your being enraged against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses again glared at him and said, “Though you should give me all that you\\r\\nhave in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I will not stay my\\r\\nhand till I have paid all of you in full. You must fight, or fly for your\\r\\nlives; and fly, not a man of you shall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he is and\\r\\nshoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then show fight;\\r\\ndraw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows. Let us\\r\\nhave at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can\\r\\nthen get through into the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his\\r\\nshooting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with\\r\\na loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot an arrow into his\\r\\nbreast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his liver. He dropped\\r\\nhis sword and fell doubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went\\r\\nover on to the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of\\r\\ndeath, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and get him\\r\\naway from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him, and struck him from\\r\\nbehind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his\\r\\nchest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his\\r\\nforehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the\\r\\nbody, for he feared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans\\r\\nmight come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off\\r\\nat a run, and immediately was at his father’s side. Then he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for your\\r\\ntemples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour for the\\r\\nswineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Run and fetch them,” answered Ulysses, “while my arrows hold out, or when I am\\r\\nalone they may get me away from the door.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where the\\r\\narmour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets\\r\\nwith horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father, and armed\\r\\nhimself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armour,\\r\\nand took their places near Ulysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows\\r\\nlasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one\\r\\nanother: when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall\\r\\nof the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his\\r\\nshoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of\\r\\nhorse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,[168] and he grasped two redoubtable\\r\\nbronze-shod spears.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow there was a trap door[169] on the wall, while at one end of\\r\\nthe pavement[170]\\r\\nthere was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed by a\\r\\nwell-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door and guard it, for\\r\\nonly one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus shouted out, “Cannot\\r\\nsome one go up to the trap door and tell the people what is going on? Help\\r\\nwould come at once, and we should soon make an end of this man and his\\r\\nshooting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This may not be, Agelaus,” answered Melanthius, “the mouth of the narrow\\r\\npassage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One brave man\\r\\ncould prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I will do, I will\\r\\nbring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is there that Ulysses and\\r\\nhis son have put them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store-room of\\r\\nUlysses’ house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets and spears,\\r\\nand brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the suitors. Ulysses’\\r\\nheart began to fail him when he saw the suitors[171] putting on their armour and\\r\\nbrandishing their spears. He saw the greatness of the danger, and said to\\r\\nTelemachus, “Some one of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or\\r\\nit may be Melanthius.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left the\\r\\nstore room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I have. Go,\\r\\nEumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the women who is doing\\r\\nthis, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the son of Dolius.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the store room\\r\\nto fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to Ulysses who was\\r\\nbeside him, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that scoundrel Melanthius,\\r\\njust as we suspected, who is going to the store room. Say, shall I kill him, if\\r\\nI can get the better of him, or shall I bring him here that you may take your\\r\\nown revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check, no matter\\r\\nwhat they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius’ hands and feet behind\\r\\nhim. Throw him into the store room and make the door fast behind you; then\\r\\nfasten a noose about his body, and string him close up to the rafters from a\\r\\nhigh bearing-post,[172] that he may linger on in an agony.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the store\\r\\nroom, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was busy searching\\r\\nfor arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two took their stand on\\r\\neither side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthius came out with a helmet\\r\\nin one hand, and an old dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by\\r\\nLaertes when he was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the\\r\\nstraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the\\r\\nhair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well\\r\\nbehind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses had told\\r\\nthem; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up from a high\\r\\npillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O\\r\\nswineherd Eumaeus saying, “Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as\\r\\nyou deserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the streams of\\r\\nOceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to\\r\\nfeast on.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on their\\r\\narmour they closed the door behind them and went back to take their places by\\r\\nthe side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the cloister, fierce and\\r\\nfull of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the body of the court were still\\r\\nboth brave and many. Then Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having\\r\\nassumed the voice and form of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and\\r\\nsaid, “Mentor, lend me your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many\\r\\ngood turns he has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the other\\r\\nside raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to reproach her.\\r\\n“Mentor,” he cried, “do not let Ulysses beguile you into siding with him and\\r\\nfighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when we have killed these\\r\\npeople, father and son, we will kill you too. You shall pay for it with your\\r\\nhead, and when we have killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out,\\r\\nand bring it into hotch-pot with Ulysses’ property; we will not let your sons\\r\\nlive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live\\r\\nin the city of Ithaca.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very angrily.[173] “Ulysses,”\\r\\nsaid she, “your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you\\r\\nfought for nine long years among the Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You\\r\\nkilled many a man in those days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam’s\\r\\ncity was taken. How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that\\r\\nyou are on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house?\\r\\nCome on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcimus\\r\\nshall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still further to\\r\\nprove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew up to one of the\\r\\nrafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\\r\\nPisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon the\\r\\nsuitors’ side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives they were\\r\\nby far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen under the arrows of\\r\\nUlysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, “My friends, he will soon have to\\r\\nleave off, for Mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.\\r\\nThey are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but\\r\\nsix of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with\\r\\nglory by killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the\\r\\nothers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of no\\r\\neffect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the pointed shaft\\r\\nof another struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of\\r\\nthe suitors Ulysses said to his own men, “My friends, I should say we too had\\r\\nbetter let drive into the middle of them, or they will crown all the harm they\\r\\nhave done us by killing us outright.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears. Ulysses\\r\\nkilled Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while the stockman\\r\\nkilled Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others drew back into a\\r\\ncorner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained their spears by drawing\\r\\nthem from the bodies of the dead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their weapons for\\r\\nthe most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the cloister; another\\r\\nwent against the door; while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall.\\r\\nStill, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off Telemachus’s\\r\\nwrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze Eumaeus’s shoulder above his shield; but\\r\\nthe spear went on and fell to the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive\\r\\ninto the crowd of suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and\\r\\nEumaeus Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\\r\\ntaunted him saying, “Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so foolish as\\r\\nto talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your speech, for the gods\\r\\nare far stronger than men. I make you a present of this advice to repay you for\\r\\nthe foot which you gave Ulysses when he was begging about in his own house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a spear in\\r\\nclose fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in the belly, and the\\r\\ndart went clean through him, so that he fell forward full on his face upon the\\r\\nground. Then Minerva from her seat on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and\\r\\nthe hearts of the suitors quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like\\r\\na herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at\\r\\ntheir longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop\\r\\ndown on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill them,\\r\\nfor they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the sport—even so did\\r\\nUlysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They\\r\\nmade a horrible groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground\\r\\nseethed with their blood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, “Ulysses I beseech you have\\r\\nmercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women in your house\\r\\neither in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I saw them, but they\\r\\nwould not listen, and now they are paying for their folly. I was their\\r\\nsacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die without having done anything to\\r\\ndeserve it, and shall have got no thanks for all the good that I did.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, “If you were their sacrificing\\r\\npriest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before I got\\r\\nhome again, and that you might marry my wife and have children by her.\\r\\nTherefore you shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when he was\\r\\nbeing killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he struck Leiodes on\\r\\nthe back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was\\r\\nyet speaking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes—he who had been forced by the suitors to\\r\\nsing to them—now tried to save his life. He was standing near towards the trap\\r\\ndoor,[174] and\\r\\nheld his lyre in his hand. He did not know whether to fly out of the cloister\\r\\nand sit down by the altar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which\\r\\nboth Laertes and Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or\\r\\nwhether to go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he\\r\\ndeemed it best to embrace Ulysses’ knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground\\r\\nbetween the mixing bowl [175] and the silver-studded seat; then\\r\\ngoing up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, “Ulysses, I beseech\\r\\nyou have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards if you\\r\\nkill a bard who can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays\\r\\nmyself, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration. I would sing to\\r\\nyou as though you were a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my\\r\\nhead off. Your own son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent\\r\\nyour house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many\\r\\nand too strong for me, so they made me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. “Hold!” he cried, “the\\r\\nman is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will spare Medon too, who was always\\r\\ngood to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus has already killed\\r\\nhim, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging about the court.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a seat\\r\\nbeneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly flayed\\r\\nheifer’s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus, and laid hold\\r\\nof his knees.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here I am, my dear sir,” said he, “stay your hand therefore, and tell your\\r\\nfather, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for having wasted\\r\\nhis substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, “Fear not; Telemachus has saved your life,\\r\\nthat you may know in future, and tell other people, how greatly better good\\r\\ndeeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside the cloisters into the\\r\\nouter court, and be out of the way of the slaughter—you and the bard—while I\\r\\nfinish my work here inside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down by\\r\\nJove’s great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting that they\\r\\nwould be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully over, to see\\r\\nif anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, but he found them\\r\\nall lying in the dust and weltering in their blood. They were like fishes which\\r\\nfishermen have netted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping\\r\\nfor water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the\\r\\nsuitors lying all huddled up one against the other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, “Call nurse Euryclea; I have something to say\\r\\nto her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women’s room. “Make haste,” said\\r\\nhe, “you old woman who have been set over all the other women in the house.\\r\\nCome outside; my father wishes to speak to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women’s room and came\\r\\nout, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses bespattered with\\r\\nblood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an ox, and his breast\\r\\nand both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was\\r\\nUlysses besmirched from head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses\\r\\nand such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw\\r\\nthat a great deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, “Old woman,” said he,\\r\\n“rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about it; it\\r\\nis an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven’s doom and their own evil\\r\\ndeeds have brought these men to destruction, for they respected no man in the\\r\\nwhole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a\\r\\nbad end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me\\r\\nwhich of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and who are\\r\\ninnocent.”[176]\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you the truth, my son,” answered Euryclea. “There are fifty women\\r\\nin the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding wool, and all kinds of\\r\\nhousehold work. Of these, twelve in all[177] have misbehaved, and have been\\r\\nwanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope. They showed no disrespect to\\r\\nTelemachus, for he has only lately grown and his mother never permitted him to\\r\\ngive orders to the female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife\\r\\nall that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not wake her yet,” answered Ulysses, “but tell the women who have\\r\\nmisconducted themselves to come to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to Ulysses; in\\r\\nthe meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the swineherd. “Begin,”\\r\\nsaid he, “to remove the dead, and make the women help you. Then, get sponges\\r\\nand clean water to swill down the tables and seats. When you have thoroughly\\r\\ncleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into the space between the domed\\r\\nroom and the wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swords\\r\\ntill they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in\\r\\nwhich they used to lie in secret with the suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly. First they\\r\\ncarried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one another in the\\r\\ngatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do their work quickly, so\\r\\nthey had to carry the bodies out. When they had done this, they cleaned all the\\r\\ntables and seats with sponges and water, while Telemachus and the two others\\r\\nshovelled up the blood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all\\r\\naway and put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite\\r\\nclean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space\\r\\nbetween the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not\\r\\nget away: and Telemachus said to the other two, “I shall not let these women\\r\\ndie a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my mother, and used to\\r\\nsleep with the suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo saying he made a ship’s cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that\\r\\nsupported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the building,\\r\\nat a good height, lest any of the women’s feet should touch the ground; and as\\r\\nthrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a thicket\\r\\njust as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even\\r\\nso did the women have to put their heads in nooses one after the other and die\\r\\nmost miserably.[178] Their feet moved convulsively for a\\r\\nwhile, but not for very long.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner court.\\r\\nThere they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his vitals and gave\\r\\nthem to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back into the\\r\\nhouse, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear old nurse Euryclea,\\r\\n“Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also that I may\\r\\nburn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here\\r\\nwith her attendants, and also all the maidservants that are in the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All that you have said is true,” answered Euryclea, “but let me bring you some\\r\\nclean clothes—a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on your back any\\r\\nlonger. It is not right.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First light me a fire,” replied Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses thoroughly\\r\\npurified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts. Then she went\\r\\ninside to call the women and tell them what had happened; whereon they came\\r\\nfrom their apartment with torches in their hands, and pressed round Ulysses to\\r\\nembrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and taking hold of his hands. It\\r\\nmade him feel as if he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of\\r\\nthem.[179]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXIII\\n\\r\\nPENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND—EARLY IN THE MORNING ULYSSES,\\r\\nTELEMACHUS, EUMAEUS, AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband\\r\\nhad come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet were nimble for\\r\\njoy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her.\\r\\n“Wake up Penelope, my dear child,” she exclaimed, “and see with your own eyes\\r\\nsomething that you have been wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last\\r\\nindeed come home again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much\\r\\ntrouble in his house, eating up his estate and ill treating his son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My good nurse,” answered Penelope, “you must be mad. The gods sometimes send\\r\\nsome very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish people become\\r\\nsensible. This is what they must have been doing to you; for you always used to\\r\\nbe a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough\\r\\nalready—talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had\\r\\ntaken possession of my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from\\r\\nthe day my poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back\\r\\nagain into the women’s room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up to\\r\\nbring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe scolding.\\r\\nAs it is your age shall protect you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear child,” answered Euryclea, “I am not mocking you. It is quite true as\\r\\nI tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger whom they all\\r\\nkept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus knew all the time that he\\r\\nwas come back, but kept his father’s secret that he might have his revenge on\\r\\nall these wicked people.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea, and wept\\r\\nfor joy. “But my dear nurse,” said she, “explain this to me; if he has really\\r\\ncome home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single\\r\\nhanded, seeing what a number of them there always were?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was not there,” answered Euryclea, “and do not know; I only heard them\\r\\ngroaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled up in a\\r\\ncorner of the women’s room with the doors closed, till your son came to fetch\\r\\nme because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses standing over the corpses\\r\\nthat were lying on the ground all round him, one on top of the other. You would\\r\\nhave enjoyed it if you could have seen him standing there all bespattered with\\r\\nblood and filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all\\r\\npiled up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a\\r\\ngreat fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call you, so\\r\\ncome with me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last the\\r\\ndesire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is come home to find both\\r\\nwife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his own house on the\\r\\nsuitors who behaved so badly to him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “do not exult too confidently over all this.\\r\\nYou know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses come home—more\\r\\nparticularly myself, and the son who has been born to both of us; but what you\\r\\ntell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is angry with the suitors for\\r\\ntheir great wickedness, and has made an end of them; for they respected no man\\r\\nin the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have\\r\\ncome to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away\\r\\nfrom the Achaean land; he will never return home again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen nurse Euryclea said, “My child, what are you talking about? but you were\\r\\nall hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband is never\\r\\ncoming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side at this very\\r\\nmoment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I was washing him I\\r\\nperceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I wanted to tell you about\\r\\nit, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth;\\r\\nso come with me and I will make this bargain with you—if I am deceiving you,\\r\\nyou may have me killed by the most cruel death you can think of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “however wise you may be you can hardly fathom\\r\\nthe counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of my son, that I\\r\\nmay see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has killed them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she considered\\r\\nwhether she should keep at a distance from her husband and question him, or\\r\\nwhether she should at once go up to him and embrace him. When, however, she had\\r\\ncrossed the stone floor of the cloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the\\r\\nfire, against the wall at right angles[180] [to that by which she had entered],\\r\\nwhile Ulysses sat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and\\r\\nwaiting to see what his brave wife would say to him when she saw him. For a\\r\\nlong time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked\\r\\nhim full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his shabby\\r\\nclothes and failed to recognise him,[181] till Telemachus began to reproach\\r\\nher and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mother—but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name—why do you\\r\\nkeep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his side and begin\\r\\ntalking to him and asking him questions? No other woman could bear to keep away\\r\\nfrom her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,\\r\\nand after having gone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a\\r\\nstone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope answered, “My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find no\\r\\nwords in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I cannot even look\\r\\nhim straight in the face. Still, if he really is Ulysses come back to his own\\r\\nhome again, we shall get to understand one another better by and by, for there\\r\\nare tokens with which we two are alone acquainted, and which are hidden from\\r\\nall others.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, “Let your mother put me to any\\r\\nproof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently. She rejects me\\r\\nfor the moment and believes me to be somebody else, because I am covered with\\r\\ndirt and have such bad clothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better\\r\\ndo next. When one man has killed another—even though he was not one who would\\r\\nleave many friends to take up his quarrel—the man who has killed him must still\\r\\nsay good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing\\r\\nthe stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you\\r\\nconsider this matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Look to it yourself, father,” answered Telemachus, “for they say you are the\\r\\nwisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other mortal man who can\\r\\ncompare with you. We will follow you with right good will, nor shall you find\\r\\nus fail you in so far as our strength holds out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will say what I think will be best,” answered Ulysses. “First wash and put\\r\\nyour shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and dress; Phemius\\r\\nshall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside hear,\\r\\nor any of the neighbours, or some one going along the street happens to notice\\r\\nit, they may think there is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the\\r\\ndeath of the suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the\\r\\nwoods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven\\r\\nvouchsafes us shall seem wisest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed and put\\r\\ntheir shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took his lyre and set\\r\\nthem all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The house re-echoed with the\\r\\nsound of men and women dancing, and the people outside said, “I suppose the\\r\\nqueen has been getting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for\\r\\nnot continuing to protect her husband’s property until he comes home.”[182]\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had been\\r\\nhappening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses in his own\\r\\nhouse and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him look taller and\\r\\nstronger than before; she also made the hair grow thick on the top of his head,\\r\\nand flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head\\r\\nand shoulders just as a skilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under\\r\\nVulcan or Minerva—and his work is full of beauty—enriches a piece of silver\\r\\nplate by gilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals,\\r\\nand sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. “My dear,” said he,\\r\\n“heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had.\\r\\nNo other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back\\r\\nto her after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through so much.\\r\\nBut come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will sleep alone, for this woman has\\r\\na heart as hard as iron.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear,” answered Penelope, “I have no wish to set myself up, nor to\\r\\ndepreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well\\r\\nremember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.\\r\\nNevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he himself\\r\\nbuilt. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it with fleeces,\\r\\ngood coverlets, and blankets.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, “Wife, I am much\\r\\ndispleased at what you have just been saying. Who has been taking my bed from\\r\\nthe place in which I left it? He must have found it a hard task, no matter how\\r\\nskilled a workman he was, unless some god came and helped him to shift it.\\r\\nThere is no man living, however strong and in his prime, who could move it from\\r\\nits place, for it is a marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own\\r\\nhands. There was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in\\r\\nfull vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this\\r\\nwith strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors\\r\\nstrong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and\\r\\nleft the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root upwards and then\\r\\nworked with carpenter’s tools well and skilfully, straightening my work by\\r\\ndrawing a line on the wood, and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole\\r\\ndown the middle, and made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I worked till\\r\\nI had finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a\\r\\nhide of crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you see I know all\\r\\nabout it, and I desire to learn whether it is still there, or whether any one\\r\\nhas been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its roots.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke down. She\\r\\nflew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck, and kissed him. “Do\\r\\nnot be angry with me Ulysses,” she cried, “you, who are the wisest of mankind.\\r\\nWe have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied us the happiness of spending\\r\\nour youth, and of growing old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it\\r\\namiss that I did not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have been\\r\\nshuddering all the time through fear that someone might come here and deceive\\r\\nme with a lying story; for there are many very wicked people going about.\\r\\nJove’s daughter Helen would never have yielded herself to a man from a foreign\\r\\ncountry, if she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and\\r\\nbring her back. Heaven put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought\\r\\nto that sin, which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now, however, that\\r\\nyou have convinced me by showing that you know all about our bed (which no\\r\\nhuman being has ever seen but you and I and a single maidservant, the daughter\\r\\nof Actor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who keeps the doors\\r\\nof our room) hard of belief though I have been I can mistrust no longer.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and faithful\\r\\nwife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who are swimming\\r\\ntowards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship with the fury of his\\r\\nwinds and waves; a few alone reach the land, and these, covered with brine, are\\r\\nthankful when they find themselves on firm ground and out of danger—even so was\\r\\nher husband welcome to her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her\\r\\ntwo fair arms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging\\r\\ntheir sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined\\r\\notherwise, and held night back in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn\\r\\nto leave Oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear her\\r\\nonward to break the day upon mankind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt last, however, Ulysses said, “Wife, we have not yet reached the end of our\\r\\ntroubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo. It is long and\\r\\ndifficult, but I must go through with it, for thus the shade of Teiresias\\r\\nprophesied concerning me, on the day when I went down into Hades to ask about\\r\\nmy return and that of my companions. But now let us go to bed, that we may lie\\r\\ndown and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You shall go to bed as soon as you please,” replied Penelope, “now that the\\r\\ngods have sent you home to your own good house and to your country. But as\\r\\nheaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell me about the task that lies\\r\\nbefore you. I shall have to hear about it later, so it is better that I should\\r\\nbe told at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear,” answered Ulysses, “why should you press me to tell you? Still, I\\r\\nwill not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I do not like it\\r\\nmyself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide, carrying an oar, till I came\\r\\nto a country where the people have never heard of the sea, and do not even mix\\r\\nsalt with their food. They know nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the\\r\\nwings of a ship. He gave me this certain token which I will not hide from you.\\r\\nHe said that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing\\r\\nshovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in the ground\\r\\nand sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune; after which I was to go\\r\\nhome and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven, one after the other. As for\\r\\nmyself, he said that death should come to me from the sea, and that my life\\r\\nshould ebb away very gently when I was full of years and peace of mind, and my\\r\\npeople should bless me. All this, he said, should surely come to pass.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Penelope said, “If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier time in\\r\\nyour old age, you may hope then to have some respite from misfortune.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made\\r\\nthe bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid them, the nurse\\r\\nwent back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber woman\\r\\nEurynome[183] to\\r\\nshow Ulysses and Penelope to bed by torch light. When she had conducted them to\\r\\ntheir room she went back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own\\r\\nold bed. Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\\r\\nmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the\\r\\ncloisters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking with one\\r\\nanother. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing the house filled\\r\\nwith a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many sheep and oxen on her\\r\\naccount, and had drunk so many casks of wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what\\r\\nhe had suffered, and how much trouble he had himself given to other people. He\\r\\ntold her everything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to\\r\\nsleep till he had ended his whole story.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached the\\r\\nfertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops and how he\\r\\nhad punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; how he then\\r\\nwent on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered him on his way,\\r\\nbut even so he was not to reach home, for to his great grief a hurricane\\r\\ncarried him out to sea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian city\\r\\nTelepylos, where the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save\\r\\nhimself and his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and\\r\\nhow he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the Theban\\r\\nprophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who\\r\\nbore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the wondrous\\r\\nsinging of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and terrible\\r\\nCharybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men\\r\\nthen ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with\\r\\nhis thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone being\\r\\nleft alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso,\\r\\nwho kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in\\r\\nwhich case she intended making him immortal so that he should never grow old,\\r\\nbut she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how after much suffering\\r\\nhe had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had\\r\\nbeen a god, and sent him back in a ship to his own country after having given\\r\\nhim gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last thing about\\r\\nwhich he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the\\r\\nburden of his sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that Ulysses had\\r\\nhad both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of\\r\\nOceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On this, Ulysses rose from his\\r\\ncomfortable bed and said to Penelope, “Wife, we have both of us had our full\\r\\nshare of troubles, you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented\\r\\nfrom getting home though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however,\\r\\nthat we have at last come together, take care of the property that is in the\\r\\nhouse. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will\\r\\ntake many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to\\r\\nmake good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now going to\\r\\nthe wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has so long been\\r\\ngrieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these instructions, though\\r\\nyou have little need of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have\\r\\nbeen killing the suitors; go upstairs, therefore,[184] and stay there with your women. See\\r\\nnobody and ask no questions.”[185]\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius, and\\r\\nEumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. This they did, and\\r\\narmed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the gates and sallied\\r\\nforth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now daylight, but Minerva nevertheless\\r\\nconcealed them in darkness and led them quickly out of the town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXIV\\n\\r\\nTHE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES—ULYSSES AND HIS MEN GO TO THE HOUSE OF\\r\\nLAERTES—THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT TO ATTACK ULYSSES, BUT MINERVA CONCLUDES\\r\\nA PEACE.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his hand he\\r\\nheld the fair golden wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them\\r\\njust as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts and led them, while they\\r\\nfollowed whining and gibbering behind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow\\r\\nof some great cave, when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which\\r\\nthey hang, even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of\\r\\nsorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the\\r\\nwaters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the sun and\\r\\nthe land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell the\\r\\nsouls and shadows of them that can labour no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of Patroclus,\\r\\nAntilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man of all the Danaans\\r\\nafter the son of Peleus himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of Agamemnon\\r\\njoined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also the ghosts of\\r\\nthose who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus; and the ghost of\\r\\nAchilles spoke first.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Son of Atreus,” it said, “we used to say that Jove had loved you better from\\r\\nfirst to last than any other hero, for you were captain over many and brave\\r\\nmen, when we were all fighting together before Troy; yet the hand of death,\\r\\nwhich no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too early. Better for you had\\r\\nyou fallen at Troy in the hey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have\\r\\nbuilt a mound over your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good\\r\\nname, whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Happy son of Peleus,” answered the ghost of Agamemnon, “for having died at\\r\\nTroy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the Achaeans fell\\r\\nround you fighting for your body. There you lay in the whirling clouds of dust,\\r\\nall huge and hugely, heedless now of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the\\r\\nlivelong day, nor should we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane\\r\\nto stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid\\r\\nyou on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments.\\r\\nThe Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,\\r\\nwhen she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and the\\r\\nsound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked\\r\\nfor fear. They would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old\\r\\nNestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, ‘Hold, Argives, fly\\r\\nnot sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea with her\\r\\nimmortal nymphs to view the body of her son.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the old man\\r\\nof the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in immortal\\r\\nraiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in\\r\\nlament—calling and answering one another; there was not an Argive but wept for\\r\\npity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights seven and ten we mourned you,\\r\\nmortals and immortals, but on the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and\\r\\nmany a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were\\r\\nburnt in raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\\r\\nhorse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning, with\\r\\nthe tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done their\\r\\nwork, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and\\r\\nin pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold them—gift of\\r\\nBacchus, and work of Vulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones\\r\\nwith those of Patroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also\\r\\nthose of Antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades\\r\\nnow that Patroclus was no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point jutting out\\r\\nover the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far out upon the sea by\\r\\nthose now living and by them that shall be born hereafter. Your mother begged\\r\\nprizes from the gods, and offered them to be contended for by the noblest of\\r\\nthe Achaeans. You must have been present at the funeral of many a hero, when\\r\\nthe young men gird themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death\\r\\nof some great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\\r\\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death your\\r\\nfame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore among all\\r\\nmankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were\\r\\ndone? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the hands of Aegisthus\\r\\nand those of my wicked wife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the ghosts\\r\\nof the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of Agamemnon and\\r\\nAchilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to them at once. The ghost\\r\\nof Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had\\r\\nbeen his host, so it began to talk to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Amphimedon,” it said, “what has happened to all you fine young men—all of an\\r\\nage too—that you are come down here under the ground? One could pick no finer\\r\\nbody of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you\\r\\nwhen you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the mainland\\r\\nwhen you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of\\r\\ntheir wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you\\r\\nnot remember how I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to\\r\\njoin us with his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume\\r\\nour voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, “Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I\\r\\nremember everything that you have said, and will tell you fully and accurately\\r\\nabout the way in which our end was brought about. Ulysses had been long gone,\\r\\nand we were courting his wife, who did not say point blank that she would not\\r\\nmarry, nor yet bring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our\\r\\ndestruction: this, then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great\\r\\ntambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine\\r\\nneedlework. ‘Sweethearts,’ said she, ‘Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not\\r\\npress me to marry again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in\\r\\nneedlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,\\r\\nagainst the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of\\r\\nthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.’ This is what she said,\\r\\nand we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great web all day\\r\\nlong, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She\\r\\nfooled us in this way for three years without our finding it out, but as time\\r\\nwore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many\\r\\ndays had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told\\r\\nus, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it\\r\\nwhether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after\\r\\nshe had had it washed,[186] its splendour was as that of the\\r\\nsun or moon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his\\r\\nswineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from a voyage\\r\\nto Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched their plot for our\\r\\ndestruction. Telemachus came first, and then after him, accompanied by the\\r\\nswineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and leaning on a staff as though he were\\r\\nsome miserable old beggar. He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him,\\r\\nnot even the older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him.\\r\\nHe endured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his\\r\\nown house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and\\r\\nTelemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors\\r\\nbehind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of\\r\\niron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of\\r\\nour end, for not one of us could string the bow—nor nearly do so. When it was\\r\\nabout to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should\\r\\nnot be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his\\r\\nhaving it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his\\r\\narrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured\\r\\nhis arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous,\\r\\nand then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell\\r\\nthick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping them,\\r\\nfor they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there\\r\\nwas a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the\\r\\nground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and\\r\\nour bodies are lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends\\r\\nat home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and\\r\\nwash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the\\r\\noffices due to the departed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,” replied the ghost of Agamemnon, “you are\\r\\nindeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare excellence of\\r\\nunderstanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the daughter of\\r\\nIcarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue shall never die, and the immortals\\r\\nshall compose a song that shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the\\r\\nconstancy of Penelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of\\r\\nTyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men,\\r\\nfor she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels of the\\r\\nearth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the town and soon reached\\r\\nthe fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which he had reclaimed with infinite\\r\\nlabour. Here was his house, with a lean-to running all round it, where the\\r\\nslaves who worked for him slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there\\r\\nwas an old Sicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When\\r\\nUlysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner. Meanwhile\\r\\nI want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to recognise me after so\\r\\nlong an absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who went\\r\\nstraight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to make trial\\r\\nof his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he did not see Dolius,\\r\\nnor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they were all gathering\\r\\nthorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place where the old man had\\r\\ntold them; he therefore found his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a\\r\\ndirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs\\r\\nof oxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather;\\r\\nhe had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When\\r\\nUlysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall\\r\\npear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and\\r\\ntell him all about his having come home, or whether he should first question\\r\\nhim and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with\\r\\nhim, so in this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging\\r\\nabout a plant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see, sir,” said Ulysses, “that you are an excellent gardener—what pains you\\r\\ntake with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a fig tree, vine,\\r\\nolive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your attention. I trust,\\r\\nhowever, that you will not be offended if I say that you take better care of\\r\\nyour garden than of yourself. You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It\\r\\ncannot be because you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you,\\r\\nindeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim\\r\\nyou of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of those who should\\r\\nwash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do; but\\r\\ntell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you\\r\\nworking? Tell me also about another matter. Is this place that I have come to\\r\\nreally Ithaca? I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and\\r\\nhad not the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old\\r\\nfriend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the\\r\\nhouse of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once\\r\\nwhen I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I\\r\\nliked better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father was\\r\\nLaertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all\\r\\nthe abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary\\r\\npresents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with\\r\\nflowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of\\r\\ntapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve\\r\\nfair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this I added four good\\r\\nlooking women skilled in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis father shed tears and answered, “Sir, you have indeed come to the country\\r\\nthat you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked people. All this\\r\\nwealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If you could have found your\\r\\nfriend here alive in Ithaca, he would have entertained you hospitably and would\\r\\nhave requited your presents amply when you left him—as would have been only\\r\\nright considering what you had already given him. But tell me, and tell me\\r\\ntrue, how many years is it since you entertained this guest—my unhappy son, as\\r\\never was? Alas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea\\r\\nhave eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some\\r\\ncontinent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could\\r\\nthrow our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent\\r\\nand richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his\\r\\ndeath bed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But\\r\\nnow, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you—tell me of your\\r\\ntown and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you and your men to\\r\\nIthaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man’s ship, and those who brought\\r\\nyou here have gone on their way and left you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you everything,” answered Ulysses, “quite truly. I come from\\r\\nAlybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who is the son of\\r\\nPolypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off my course as I was\\r\\nleaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against my will. As for my ship\\r\\nit is lying over yonder, off the open country outside the town, and this is the\\r\\nfifth year since Ulysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good\\r\\nfor him when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and\\r\\nI rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have\\r\\nanother friendly meeting and exchange presents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both hands\\r\\nwith the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey head, groaning\\r\\nheavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched, and his nostrils\\r\\nquivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang towards him, flung his\\r\\narms about him and kissed him, saying, “I am he, father, about whom you are\\r\\nasking—I have returned after having been away for twenty years. But cease your\\r\\nsighing and lamentation—we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I\\r\\nhave been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence\\r\\nand crimes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you really are my son Ulysses,” replied Laertes, “and have come back again,\\r\\nyou must give me such manifest proof of your identity as shall convince me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First observe this scar,” answered Ulysses, “which I got from a boar’s tusk\\r\\nwhen I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me to\\r\\nAutolycus, my mother’s father, to receive the presents which when he was over\\r\\nhere he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out to you the trees\\r\\nin the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed\\r\\nyou round the garden. We went over them all, and you told me their names and\\r\\nwhat they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty\\r\\nfig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn\\r\\nplanted between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of\\r\\nheaven has been laid heavy upon them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes’ strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which his son\\r\\nhad given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to support him, or\\r\\nhe would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he came to, and was\\r\\nbeginning to recover his senses, he said, “O father Jove, then you gods are\\r\\nstill in Olympus after all, if the suitors have really been punished for their\\r\\ninsolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the\\r\\ntownspeople of Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers\\r\\neverywhere throughout the cities of the Cephallenians.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that, but let\\r\\nus go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told Telemachus,\\r\\nPhiloetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as\\r\\npossible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got there\\r\\nthey found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and\\r\\nmixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took Laertes inside and washed\\r\\nhim and anointed him with oil. She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up\\r\\nto him and gave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter\\r\\nthan before. When he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like\\r\\nan immortal, and said to him, “My dear father, some one of the gods has been\\r\\nmaking you much taller and better-looking.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes answered, “Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were the\\r\\nman I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took Nericum, that strong\\r\\nfortress on the foreland. If I were still what I then was and had been in our\\r\\nhouse yesterday with my armour on, I should have been able to stand by you and\\r\\nhelp you against the suitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and\\r\\nyou would have rejoiced to see it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their work and\\r\\nthe feast was ready, left off working, and took each his proper place on the\\r\\nbenches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old Dolius and his sons\\r\\nleft their work and came up, for their mother, the Sicel woman who looked after\\r\\nLaertes now that he was growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw\\r\\nUlysses and were certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but\\r\\nUlysses scolded them good naturedly and said, “Sit down to your dinner, old\\r\\nman, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some\\r\\ntime and have been waiting for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. “Sir,” said he,\\r\\nseizing his master’s hand and kissing it at the wrist, “we have long been\\r\\nwishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we had given up\\r\\nhoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you.[187] But tell me,\\r\\ndoes Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send some one to tell\\r\\nher?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Old man,” answered Ulysses, “she knows already, so you need not trouble about\\r\\nthat.” On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered round Ulysses\\r\\nto give him greeting and embrace him one after the other; then they took their\\r\\nseats in due order near Dolius their father.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round the\\r\\ntown, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the suitors; as\\r\\nsoon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered from every quarter,\\r\\ngroaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses. They took the dead away,\\r\\nburied every man his own, and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere\\r\\non board the fishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his own\\r\\nplace. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got\\r\\ntogether Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death\\r\\nof his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said,\\r\\nweeping bitterly, “My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He\\r\\ntook many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both\\r\\nships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been killing all the\\r\\nforemost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and doing before he can get\\r\\naway to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of\\r\\nourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we\\r\\ndo not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should\\r\\nhave no more pleasure in life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then,\\r\\nand after them, before they can cross over to the main land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard Phemius\\r\\nhad now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses. Every one was\\r\\nastonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of the assembly, and\\r\\nMedon said, “Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did not do these things against\\r\\nthe will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god take the form of Mentor and\\r\\nstand beside him. This god appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and\\r\\nnow going furiously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell\\r\\nthick on one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor, rose\\r\\nto speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past and future; so\\r\\nhe spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as they\\r\\nhave; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we bade you check the\\r\\nfolly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the wantonness of their\\r\\nhearts—wasting the substance and dishonouring the wife of a chieftain who they\\r\\nthought would not return. Now, however, let it be as I say, and do as I tell\\r\\nyou. Do not go out against Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing\\r\\ndown evil on your own heads.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at once left\\r\\nthe assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the speech of\\r\\nHalitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they therefore\\r\\nhurried off for their armour, and when they had armed themselves, they met\\r\\ntogether in front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in their folly. He\\r\\nthought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was\\r\\nnever to return, but was himself to perish in his attempt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva said to Jove, “Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer me\\r\\nthis question—What do you propose to do? Will you set them fighting still\\r\\nfurther, or will you make peace between them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Jove answered, “My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your own\\r\\narrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors? Do\\r\\nwhatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be most reasonable\\r\\narrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant,\\r\\nin virtue of which he shall continue to rule, while we cause the others to\\r\\nforgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then all\\r\\nbecome friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she darted from\\r\\noff the topmost summits of Olympus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by saying, “Some\\r\\nof you go out and see if they are not getting close up to us.” So one of\\r\\nDolius’s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the threshold he could see them\\r\\nall quite near, and said to Ulysses, “Here they are, let us put on our armour\\r\\nat once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could—that is to say Ulysses, his\\r\\nthree men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did the\\r\\nsame—warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they had all put\\r\\non their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form and voice\\r\\nof Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to his son Telemachus,\\r\\n“Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an engagement, which will show\\r\\nevery man’s mettle, be sure not to disgrace your ancestors, who were eminent\\r\\nfor their strength and courage all the world over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You say truly, my dear father,” answered Telemachus, “and you shall see, if\\r\\nyou will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. “Good heavens,” he exclaimed, “what a\\r\\nday I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson are vying\\r\\nwith one another in the matter of valour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, “Son of Arceisius—-best friend I\\r\\nhave in the world—pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove her father; then\\r\\npoise your spear and hurl it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed to her\\r\\nhe poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes’ helmet, and the spear went\\r\\nright through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his armour rang rattling\\r\\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Meantime Ulysses and his son fell\\r\\nupon the front line of the foe and smote them with their swords and spears;\\r\\nindeed, they would have killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever\\r\\ngetting home again, only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one\\r\\npause. “Men of Ithaca,” she cried, “cease this dreadful war, and settle the\\r\\nmatter at once without further bloodshed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their arms\\r\\ndropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of the goddess’\\r\\nvoice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But Ulysses gave a great\\r\\ncry, and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the\\r\\nson of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so\\r\\nshe said to Ulysses, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife,\\r\\nor Jove will be angry with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed the\\r\\nform and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace between the\\r\\ntwo contending parties.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]\\r\\n [ Black races are evidently known to the writer as stretching all across\\r\\n Africa, one half looking West on to the Atlantic, and the other East on to the\\r\\n Indian Ocean.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[2]\\r\\n [ The original use of the footstool was probably less to rest the feet than to\\r\\n keep them (especially when bare) from a floor which was often wet and dirty.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[3]\\r\\n [ The θρόνος or seat, is occasionally called\\r\\n “high,” as being higher than the θρῆνυς or low\\r\\n footstool.

This reading of course should\\r\\nbe translated “Ithaca is an island fit for breeding goats, and (by your leave)\\r\\nitself a horseman rather than fit for breeding horses—for not one of the\\r\\nislands is good and well meadowed ground.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis would be sure to baffle the Alexandrian editors. “How,” they would ask\\r\\nthemselves, “could an island be a horseman?” and they would cast about for an\\r\\nemendation. A visit to the top of Mt. Eryx might perhaps make the meaning\\r\\nintelligible, and suggest my proposed restoration of the text to the reader as\\r\\nreadily as it did to myself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have elsewhere stated my conviction that the writer of the “Odyssey” was\\r\\nfamiliar with the old Sican city at the top of Mt. Eryx, and that the Aegadean\\r\\nislands which are so striking when seen thence did duty with her for the Ionian\\r\\nislands—Marettimo, the highest and most westerly of the group, standing for\\r\\nIthaca. When seen from the top of Mt. Eryx Marettimo shows as it should do\\r\\naccording to “Od.” ix. 25, 26, “on the horizon, all highest up in the sea\\r\\ntowards the West,” while the other islands lie “some way off it to the East.”\\r\\nAs we descend to Trapani, Marettimo appears to sink on to the top of the island\\r\\nof Levanzo, behind which it disappears. My friend, the late Signor E. Biaggini,\\r\\npointed to it once as it was just standing on the top of Levanzo, and said to\\r\\nme “Come cavalca bene” (“How well it rides”), and this immediately suggested my\\r\\nemendation to me.

From the top of the\\r\\n tower the outer world was to be told what was going on, but people could not\\r\\n get in by the ὀρσοθύρα: they would\\r\\n have to come in by the main entrance, and Melanthius explains that the mouth\\r\\n of the narrow passage (which was in the lands of Ulysses and his friends)\\r\\n commanded the only entrance by which help could come, so that there would be\\r\\n nothing gained by raising an alarm.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As for the ῥῶγες of line 143, no commentator\\r\\nancient or modern has been able to say what was intended—but whatever they\\r\\nwere, Melanthius could never carry twelve shields, twelve helmets, and twelve\\r\\nspears. Moreover, where he could go the others could go also. If a dozen\\r\\nsuitors had followed Melanthius into the house they could have attacked Ulysses\\r\\nin the rear, in which case, unless Minerva had intervened promptly, the\\r\\n“Odyssey” would have had a different ending. But throughout the scene we are in\\r\\na region of extravagance rather than of true fiction—it cannot be taken\\r\\nseriously by any but the very serious, until we come to the episode of Phemius\\r\\nand Medon, where the writer begins to be at home again.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[172]\\r\\n [ I presume it was intended that there should be a hook driven into the\\r\\n bearing-post.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[173]\\r\\n [ What for?]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[174]\\r\\n [ Gr: {Greek}.

It is plain that all the authoress\\r\\n cared about was that the women should be hanged: as for attempting to realise,\\r\\n or to make her readers realise, how the hanging was done, this was of no\\r\\n consequence. The reader must take her word for it and ask no questions. Lord\\r\\n Grimthorpe wrote:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had better send you my ideas about Nausicaa’s hanging of the maids (not\\r\\n‘maidens,’ of whom Froude wrote so well in his ‘Science of History’) before I\\r\\nforget it all. Luckily for me Liddell & Scott have specially translated\\r\\nmost of the doubtful words, referring to this very place.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A ship’s cable. I don’t know how big a ship she meant, but it must have been a\\r\\nvery small one indeed if its ‘cable’ could be used to tie tightly round a\\r\\nwoman’s neck, and still more round a dozen of them ‘in a row,’ besides being\\r\\nstrong enough to hold them and pull them all up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A dozen average women would need the weight and strength of more than a dozen\\r\\nstrong heavy men even over the best pulley hung to the roof over them; and the\\r\\nidea of pulling them up by a rope hung anyhow round a pillar {Greek} is\\r\\nabsurdly impossible; and how a dozen of them could be hung dangling round one\\r\\npost is a problem which a senior wrangler would be puzzled to answer... She had\\r\\nbetter have let Telemachus use his sword as he had intended till she changed\\r\\nhis mind for him.”]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[179]\\r\\n [ Then they had all been in Ulysses’ service over twenty years; perhaps the\\r\\n twelve guilty ones had been engaged more recently.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[180]\\r\\n [ Translation very doubtful—cf. “It.” xxiv. 598.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[181]\\r\\n [ But why could she not at once ask to see the scar, of which Euryclea had\\r\\n told her, or why could not Ulysses have shown it to her?]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[182]\\r\\n [ The people of Ithaca seem to have been as fond of carping as the Phaeacians\\r\\n were in vi. 273, etc.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[183]\\r\\n [ See note [156].

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')]\n"
